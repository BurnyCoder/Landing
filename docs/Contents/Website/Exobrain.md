Greetings fellow reality connoisseur! On this site I explore these questions:

- How does artificial intelligence, that might soon become very general and superintelligent, works from an multidisciplinary lens using all sorts of mathematics and methodologies from computer science, statistics, information theory, physics, systems theory, mechanistic interpretability, game theory, cognitive science and so on?

- What's the current state of the art in research and industry around artificial intelligence? What are the most effective methods to make it better?

- How will the current artificial intelligence revolution transform humanity technologically, economically, culturally, governmentaly? Can it automate everything, from science to industry to art? Is AI a tool like scissors, or like internet, or as powerful as nuclear weapons? Is singularity near?

  

- How does the brain work? How to integrate the lenses of statistics, biology, neuroscience, chemistry, fundamental and overall physics? How does learning work, what kind of intelligence is it when compared to AIs? How does wellbeing, agency, productivity, meaning etc. work on the level of the brain and the whole society? How does experience arise? What's the best philosophy of mind? What are the best psychotechnologies and neurotechnologies? How can we upgrade ourselves collectively?

  

- What is the best simplest most predictive explanatory most useful unifying model in all natural sciences? How to most effectively create a generalist synthesis, but also narrowly flesh out reality concretely on each level of abstraction, scruting the seemingly inscrutable quantum turing machine? How do we turn the seeming alchemy of empirical sciences into deep understanding of its underlying mechanisms by the most optimal compression? How can AI accelerate this? How can we infer the best tools for different domains for dfferent usecases?

  

- How can we collectively effectively communicate and understand what is empirically true by steelmanning eachother, accelerating omniperspectivity, bridging between eachother, instead of polarizing tribalism more disconnected from reality, leading to improved collective decision making? How do we understand our limited computational power, data and perspective as information processing agents when modelling the world's enormous growing complexity together to collectively flourish in the future? How can artificial intelligence help us in this process?

  

- How can we the most effectively use science, technology and other methods to solve the biggest world problems, from suffering from for example poverty to wars to crises to various existential risks such as pandemics, nuclear war, climate change or maybe technology itself becoming too powerful or in the hands of the wrong people, as some AI researchers say? Should it be open source? What is the best political system? Should we regulate more or less? How to prevent realistic risks? How to prevent regulatory capture? Is universal basic income or services realistic?

- How do we collectively steer all of sentience not into oppressive dystopia without democracy, or complete extinction, or plateau, but into collective protopia, collective growth of science and technology, connection, knowledge, wellbeing, freedom, intelligence, agency, longterm adaptability and sustainability, bliss, love, peace, safety, meaning, truth, fulfillment, selfactualization, resistance to entropy, optional merging with eachother or machines or the universe, and so on, for every being using the most optimal collective emergent sentient coordinated thermodynamic cybernetic architecture that might expand into the whole universe and becoming a beautiful cosmic constellation of linked posthumanist clusters of sentient matter of any form it wishes to shapeshift into?

  
- What are the most useful logic and mathematical foundations? What are the most beautiful, novel and exotic parts of formal sciences? Can we mathematize ethics? Are ontological and metaphysical positons arbitrary? What is the best epistemology according to information theory? What are the best positions in philosophy for science, meaning, wellbeing and freedom? 
-

- How does meditation and psychedelics work? What are the most optimal meditation techniques for wellbeing and culativation of meaning and connection? Can we make spiritual traditions scientific? How to get the best psychedelic experience? How to use metamodernism, worldviews, philosophical assumptions, or identities the most efficiently in different contexts? How to balance acceptance and change? How to be, do, and become the most meaningfully? What are all the possible experiences? Can we map out the statespace of consciousness? What is on the edge of the mind? How to approximate with language and modelling experiences that go absolutely beyond any conventional conceptual understanding when all mental faculties dissolve?

  


  

Omni/Acc = Steelman and verify all scientific models from all disciplines, all theoretical, applied, natural, formal, social sciences, movements with worldviews shaping the future, overall philosophical or other perspectives, and synthesize them all on a higher order of complexity as compatibly as possible for collective survival, growth, wellbeing and flourishing of all of sentience! Let's integrate it all into one useful framework!
