Greetings fellow reality connoisseur! On this site I explore these questions:

- How does artificial intelligence, that might soon become very general and superintelligent, works from an multidisciplinary lens using all sorts of mathematics and methodologies from computer science, statistics, information theory, physics, systems theory, mechanistic interpretability, game theory, cognitive science and so on?

- What's the current state of the art in research and industry around artificial intelligence? What are the most effective methods to make it better?

- How will the current artificial intelligence revolution transform humanity technologically, economically, culturally, governmentally? Can it automate everything, from science to industry to art? Is AI a tool like scissors, or like internet, or as powerful as nuclear weapons? Is singularity near?

  

- How does the brain work? How to integrate the lenses of statistics, biology, neuroscience, chemistry, fundamental or overall physics? How does learning work, what kind of intelligence is it when compared to AIs? How does wellbeing, agency, productivity, meaning etc. work on the level of the brain and the whole society? How does experience arise? What's the best philosophy of mind? What are the best psychotechnologies and neurotechnologies? How can we upgrade ourselves collectively?

  

- What is the best simpliest most predictive explanatory most useful unifying model in all natural sciences? How to most effectively create a generalist synthesis, but also narrowly flesh out reality concretely on each level of abstraction, scruting the seemingly inscrutable quantum turing machine? How do we turn the seeming alchemy of empirical sciences into deep understanding of its underlying reality by the most optimal compression? How can AI accelerate this? How can we infer the best tools for different domains for dfferent usecases?

  

- How can we collectively effectively communicate and understand what is empirically true by steelmanning eachother, accelerating omniperspectivity, bridging beetween eachother, instead of polarizing tribalism not grounded reality, leading to improved collective decision making? How do we understand our limited computational power, data and perspective as information processing agents when modelling the world's enormous growing complexity together to collectively flourish in the future? How can artificial intelligence help us?

  

- How can we the most effectively use science, technology and other methods to solve the biggest world problems, from suffering from for example poverty to wars to crises to various existecial risks such as pandemics, nuclear war, climate change or maybe technology itself becoming too powerful or in the hands of the wrong people, as some AI researchers say? Should it be open source? What is the best political system? Should we regulate more or less? How to prevent realistic risks and regulatory capture? Is universal basic income or services realistic?

- How do we collectively steer all of sentience not into opressive dystopia without democracy, or complete extinction, or platou, but into benefitial protopia, collective growth of science and technology, connection and optional merging with eachother or machines or the universe, knowledge, wellbeing, freedom, intelligence, agency, longterm adaptibility and sustainability, resistivity to entropy, bliss, love, peace, safety, meaning, truth, fullfillment, selfactualization and so on for every being using the most optimal collective emergent coordinated thermodynamic cybernetic architecture that might expand into the whole universe and becoming a beautiful cosmic constellation of linked posthumanist clusters of sentient matter of any form it wishes to be in?

  

- How does meditation and psychedelics work? What are the most optimal meditation techniques for wellbeing and culativation of meaning and connection? Can we make spiritual traditions scientific? How to get the best psychedelic experience? How to use metamodernism, worldviews, philosophical assumptions, or identities the most efficiently in different contexts? How to balance acceptance and change? What is the statespace of consciousness, what is the edge of the mind, what are all the possible exotic experiences? How to approximate with language and modelling experiences that go absolutely beyond any conventional conceptual understanding when all mental faculties dissolve?

  

- What are the most useful logic and mathematical foundations? What are the most beautiful, novel and exotic parts of formal sciences? Can we mathematize ethics? Are ontological and metaphysical positons arbitrary? What is the best epistemology according to information theory? What are the best positions in philosophy for science, meaning, wellbeing and freedom? 

  

Omni/Acc = Steelman and verify all scientific models from all disciplines, and movements shaping the future, and synthesize it all on a higher order of complexity as compatibly as possible for collective growth, survival, wellbeing and flourishing of all beings! Let's integrate it all into one useful framework! All theoretical, applied, natural, formal, social sciences and overall perspectives about our future!
