- Greetings fellow [[ontology|reality]] connoisseur!

- I explore [[artificial intelligence]], [[engineering]], [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[systems theory]], [[information theory]], [[computer science]], [[mechanistic interpretability]], [[cognitive science]], [[argumentation theory]], [[transhumanism]], [[singularity]], [[freedom]], [[growth]], [[social systems]], [[cybernetics]], [[neurotechnology]], [[wellbeing]], [[agency]], [[meaning]], [[motivation]], [[meditation]], [[psychedelics]], [[omnidisciplionary]], [[omniperspectivity]], [[philosophy]], [[risks]], [[Artificial intelligence safety]], [[Future of humanity and sentience]] of [[humanity]] in post [[Artificial general intelligence]] world and [[sentience]] in the whole [[universe]]. 
- How does [[artificial intelligence]], that might soon become very [[Artificial general intelligence|general]] and [[Artificial superintelligence|superintelligent]], works from an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] lens using all sorts of [[mathematics]] and methodologies from [[computer science]], [[Statistics]], [[information theory]], [[physics]],[[ systems theory]], [[mechanistic interpretability]], [[game theory]], [[cognitive science]] and so on? - What's the current state of the art in research and industry mainly around but not limited to [[artificial intelligence]]? What are the most effective methods to make it better? What would be considered as [[Artificial general intelligence]]  and [[Artificial superintelligence]] ? How much does [[Artificial intelligence safety]] play a role? How to create [[Theory of Everything in Intelligence]]?
- How will the current [[artificial intelligence]] revolution transform [[humanity]] [[technology|technologically]], [[economically]], [[culturally]], [[governmentaly]]? Can it [[automate]] [[everything]], from [[science]] to [[industry|technology]] to [[art]]? Is [[artificial intelligence]] a tool like scissors, or like [[internet]], or as powerful as [[nuclear weapons]]? How does existing [[technology]] already make us [[cyborg|cyborgs]]? Is [[singularity]] near? How will [[singularity]] look like? 
- What is the best simplest most [[predictive|prediction]] and [[explanation|explanatory]], most useful, integrating, unifying [[model]] in all [[Natural science|natural sciences]]? Can we translate [[everything]] into [[physics]]? How to most effectively create a [[general|generalist]] [[synthesis]], but also [[Artificial narrow intelligence|narrowly]] model [[reality]] [[concrete|concretely]] on each level of [[abstraction]], scruting the seemingly inscrutable [[reality]]'s [[quantum turing machine]]? How do we turn the seeming [[alchemy]] of [[Natural science|empirical sciences]] into deep [[understanding]] of its [[First principles thinking|underlying mechanisms]] by the most optimal [[Intelligence as compression|compression]]? How can [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] accelerate this? How can we infer the best tools for different domains for different usecases? How to create [[Theory of Everything in Fundamental Physics]], [[Theory of Everything in All of Physics]], [[Theory of Everything in Natural Sciences]], [[Theory of Everything in All of Science]], [[Theory of Everything]]?
- How can we collectively effectively communicate and understand what is empirically true by [[steelmanning]] eachother, accelerating [[omniperspectivity]], bridging between eachother, instead of [[polarization|polarizing]] tribalism more disconnected from reality, leading to improved collective [[decision making]]? How do we understand our limited [[computation|computational]] power, [[data science|data]] and [[perspective]] as [[information theory|information processing]] [[agent|agents]] when [[modelling]] the world's enormous growing [[complexity]] together to [[collective|collectively]] flourish in the [[future]], [[Future of humanity and sentience]], [[future of sentience]] and [[Future of universe]]? How can [[artificial intelligence]] help us in this [[process]]? 
- How to be not naively technooptimistic or technopessimistic when it comes to [[technology]], gathering the benefits and minimizing the [[risks of artificial intelligence]], but something in the middle, technorealistic? How can we merge [[Effective Altruism]] with [[Effective Accelerationism]]? How can we the most effectively use [[science]], [[technology]] and other methods to adapt or solve the biggest [[world problems]] and prevent [[risks]], from [[suffering]] from for example [[poverty]] to [[war|wars]] to [[crisis|crises]] to various [[existential risks]] such as natural or engineered [[pandemic|pandemics]], [[nuclear war]], [[environmental collapse]] in [[polycrisis]] and [[metacrisis]], or maybe how to prevent [[technology]] itself becoming too powerful or in the hands of the wrong people, as some AI researchers say? Should it be [[open source]]? What is the best [[political system]], [[liberalism]], [[collectivism]], [[individualism]], [[global governance]], [[benevolent dictator|benevolent dictators]], [[AI assisted governance]] or [[global AGI governance]], [[decentralization]], [[democracy]], [[anarchism]], [[minimal state]]? Should we [[regulation|regulate]] more or less? How to prevent realistic [[risks]]? How to prevent [[regulatory capture]]? Is [[universal basic income]] or [[universal basic services|services]] realistic? 
- How do we collectively steer all of [[experience|sentience]] not into oppressive [[dystopia]] without [[democracy]], or complete [[extinction]], or [[plateau]], but into [[collective]] [[protopia]], collective growth of [[science]] and [[technology]], connection, [[knowledge]], [[wellbeing]], [[drive]], [[motivation]], [[freedom]], [[intelligence]], [[agency]], longterm [[adaptability]] and [[sustainability]], [[bliss]], [[love]], [[peace]], [[safety]], [[meaning]], [[truth]], [[fulfillment]], [[selfactualization]], resistance to [[entropy]], optional [[transhumanism|transhumanistic]] merging with eachother or [[machine|machines]] or the [[universe]], and so on, for every [[being]], using the most optimal collective [[emergence|emergent]] [[selforganization|selforganized]] [[sentience|sentient]] [[coordination|coordinated]] [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] [[architecture]] that might expand into the whole [[universe]] and become a beautiful cosmic constellation of linked [[posthumanism|posthumanist]] clusters of [[sentience|sentient]] [[matter]] of [[morphological freedom|any form]] it wishes to [[shapeshift]] into?
- What is [[Life]]? How does the [[neuroscience|brain]] work? How to [[Omnidisciplionary|integrate]] the lenses of [[Statistics]], [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[chemistry]], [[fundamental physics|fundamental]] and overall [[physics]] from [[classical physics|classical]] to [[statistical physics|statistical]] to [[Quantum mechanics]] to [[quantum field theory]], [[systems theory]] or other [[mathematics]]? How does [[learning]] work, what kind of [[intelligence]] is [[biological intelligence]] compared to [[brtificial Intelligence]], what is the [[Intersection between biological and artificial intelligence]]?
