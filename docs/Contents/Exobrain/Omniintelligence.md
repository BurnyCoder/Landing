Beyond biological and artificial general intelligence and superintelligence: Omniintelligence (OI)

Omniintelligent omnimodal omnistructured omniagentic omnicapable omnisystem.

Omniintelligence is adaptable to any task, shapeshiftable into any possible physical configuration of any building blocks it can merge with or create for itself, any physical substrate, structure, algorithms, knowledge, skills, capabilities, it can have arbitrary size across all of space and time, it has access to the whole statespace of reality.

It's a system unlimited by anything, in our universe just by laws of fundamental physics and all other emergent physical laws and laws of other sciences, that it fully bends to its advantage for any hyperspecific or fully general task it wishes in our universe.

But it can also access and create its own laws of physics, it has access to the whole statespace of all possible universes with all possible laws of physics, all possible computable and noncomputable physical and mathematical systems, running on any possible possible metaphysical ontologies it wishes to.

It has infinite morphological freedom. It's basically a limitless God living in any possible subset of realities it wishes to, without any restrictions, without any constrains, transcending and including all and anything that is and that can be. It can be any structure, do any process, and create any structure.including all and anything that is and that can be. It can be any structure, do any process, and create any structure.
