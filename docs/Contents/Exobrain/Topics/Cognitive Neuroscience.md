Cognitive neuroscience bridges the gap between the study of the brain and the study of the mind, providing insights into how mental functions are grounded in brain activity. It employs a wide range of techniques to study brain function, from non-invasive imaging to the examination of neurological patients, making it a highly interdisciplinary and dynamic field.
