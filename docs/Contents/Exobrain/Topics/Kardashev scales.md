In order to get answers, we will have to ascend the [[Kardashev scales]]. This ascent will unlock perception into this higher energy band. Then we will need the [[intelligence]] to understand what we see. [[Power generation]] + [[Artificial Intelligence]] scaling are the truly [[fundamental]] missions.

## Explanation by AI 
- The Kardashev scale is a method of measuring a civilization's level of [[technological advancement]] based on the amount of [[energy]] it is able to harness and use[1][2][3][5].

The scale has three main categories[1][3]:

- Type I: Also called a Planetary [[civilization]], it can harness and store all the [[energy]] available on its planet[3][5].
- Type II: Also called a Stellar civilization, it can use and [[control]] energy on the scale of its [[planetary system]], e.g. by building [[Dyson sphere]] around stars[1][3].  
- Type III: A Galactic civilization that can harness the energy of its entire host [[galaxy]][3][5].
- Type IV: Capable of using energy at the scale of the whole [[universe]].
- Type V: Capable of using energy at the scale of [[multiverse]], manipulating multiverses beyond [[spacetime]].

The scale was originally proposed in 1964 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev[1][3]. He used the scale to estimate how detectable hypothetical [[alien]] civilizations would be based on their energy use[1].

[[Carl Sagan]] proposed a more granular version of the scale that uses decimal values, e.g. a Type 1.2 civilization[1][3]. On this version, present-day human civilization ranks at about 0.7[1][3].

While a hypothetical construct, the Kardashev scale puts the energy use of advanced civilizations into perspective and is often referenced in discussions about the search for extraterrestrial [[intelligence]] (SETI)[1].
