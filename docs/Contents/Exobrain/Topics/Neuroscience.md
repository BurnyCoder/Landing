		- [[Neurophysiology]] - study of the function (as opposed to structure) of the nervous system
		- [[Neuroanatomy]] - study of the anatomy of nervous tissue and neural structures of the nervous system
		- [[Neuropharmacology]] -  study of how [[Substance|substances]] affect cellular function in the nervous system.
			- [[Neuropsychopharmacology]] -  study of the neural mechanisms that [[Substance|substances]] act upon to influence behavior
		- [[Behavioral neuroscience]] - application of the principles of [[biology]] to the study of [[Experience|mental]] processes and behavior in human and non-human animals
		- [[Developmental neuroscience]] - aims to describe the cellular basis of brain development and to address the underlying mechanisms
		- [[Cognitive neuroscience]] - study of biological substrates underlying cognition, with a focus on the neural substrates of mental processes
		- [[Systems neuroscience]] - studies the function of neural circuits and [[System theory|systems]],.It is an umbrella term, encompassing a number of areas of study concerned with how nerve cells behave when connected together to form neural networks
		- [[Molecular neuroscience]] - examines the biology of the nervous system with [[molecular biology]], molecular [[genetics]], [[protein]] [[chemistry]] and related methodologies
		- [[Computational neuroscience]] - study of the [[Information processing theory|information processing]] functions of the nervous system, and the use of digital computers to study the nervous system instegrating [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive science]] and [[psychology]], [[electrical engineering]], [[computer science]], [[physics]] and [[mathematics]].
