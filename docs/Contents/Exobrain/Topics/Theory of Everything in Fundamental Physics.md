## Definitions
- [[Theory of Everything]] solving [[Quantum gravity]] or other ways of unifying [[Theory of relativity]] with [[quantum gravity]] through for example [[emergence]], alternatively also unifying [[Fundamental forces|fundamental forces]].
## Technical summaries
- 
## Motivation
- [[Quantum field theory]] is almost a [[Theory of Everything]], but it hasn't solved all problems in [[physics]], such as [[quantum gravity]] and others.

- [Beff Jezos](https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1751363140514947286?t=6HWzBMpLjvrMn8hTPEcYnQ&s=19): Solving for the [[Theory of Everything in Fundamental Physics]] comes down to latent model hyperparameter inference for the laws of [[physics]], where tests of these hyperparameters unfortunately lie beyond our currently observable / testable band of [[energy|energies]]. In order to get answers, we will have to ascend the [[Kardashev scale]]. This ascent will unlock perception into this higher energy band. Then we will need the [[intelligence]] to understand what we see. [[Electricity generation]] + [[Artificial Intelligence]] scaling are the truly [[fundamental]] missions.
