- Let's build reality from first principles.  
Let's describe fundamental particles governed by quantum field theory standard model and add gravity that together compose and weakly emerge equations of quantum, classical, statistical physics equations on higher levels with system theory equations with information theory and computation theory.  
These interacting quantum fields with fundamental particles on complex enough dynamics give rise to the weakly emergent equations of chemistry and that together composes to biology, neuroscience and social systems.  
We use many of those laws to engineer computers, artificial intelligence and all other technology, which has various mathematical similarities and differences with biological systems allowing for various types of compatibilities between biological and artificial systems that already allow us to understand and engineer beter AI and upgrade ourselves with neurotechnology, and this will only progress forwards.  
Planets and galaxies and the whole universe is operating under many other approximately deterministic laws.  
We can predict fundamental particles well, but there seems to be inherent randomness in the quantum wave function of probabilities. Since many nontrivial systems cannot be solved analytically, we have to approximate it with petrubation theory. Chemistry and biology adds tons of classical stochasticity and abstracting approximating equations because we cannot grasp all the variables in play there exactly for a lot of cases, but we can simulate picoseconds of a very simple chemical reaction using quantum mechanics on quantum computers in chemical physics. Societal concrete complexity is very intractable, but we can figure out some very general physical and statistical laws, like measuring fluid dynamics, thermodynamics and network theory. The more macroscopic we go, the more fundamental quantum probabilities and fluctations matter less as they cancel out and we get more deterministic, with stochastic cybernetic controlles in a nonequlibrium steady state pullback attractors forming nested hetearchy of free energy minimizing complex markov blankets ongoing all sorts of phase shifts in the configuration space of functional architectures, like organisms and society, and complexity grows as we go up the levels and, with futher tractable somewhat deterministic dynamics of planets, galaxies and cosmology.  
We still have yet to figure out so many better or new concepts, laws, frameworks, technologies in all these fields and levels of analysis. The cosmological story of the universe, why and how is there something, is still a mystery beyond our limited modelling approximating compressing perspective, data, time, computational power, it's in its fullness beyond our comprehension.
