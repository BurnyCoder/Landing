## Definitions
- Research strategy that crosses [[Discipline|disciplinary]] boundaries to create a holistic approach. It applies to research efforts focused on problems that cross the boundaries of two or more disciplines, such as research on effective [[information theory|information]] systems for biomedical research (see [[bioinformatics]]), and can refer to concepts or methods that were originally developed by one discipline, but are now used by several others, such as [[ethnography]], a field research method originally developed in [[anthropology]] but now widely used by other disciplines.

- Transdisciplinary fields are areas of study that transcend traditional boundaries of academic disciplines, creating new knowledge and approaches by integrating insights from different perspectives. These fields often emerge in response to complex real-world challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by any one discipline alone. Here's a list of some key transdisciplinary fields:

### 1. Sustainability Studies
   - Integrates ecology, economics, politics, and culture to address challenges of sustainable development and environmental conservation.

### 2. Global Health
   - Combines public health, medicine, epidemiology, anthropology, economics, and political science to improve health and achieve equity in health care worldwide.

### 3. Cognitive Science
   - Merges psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology, and artificial intelligence to understand the mind and intelligent behavior.

### 4. Environmental Science
   - Fuses biology, chemistry, physics, geology, and social sciences to study and find solutions to environmental problems.

### 5. Bioinformatics
   - Blends biology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics to analyze and interpret biological data.

### 6. Nanotechnology
   - Conjoins physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering to manipulate matter at an atomic or molecular scale.

### 7. Urban Studies and Planning
   - Merges geography, sociology, environmental planning, public policy, and urban design to study and shape urban development.

### 8. Neuroeconomics
   - Combines neuroscience, economics, and psychology to understand how people make economic decisions.

### 9. Conservation Biology
   - Integrates biology, ecology, earth sciences, and social sciences to protect, maintain, and restore biodiversity.

### 10. Science, Technology, and Society (STS)
   - Unites history, sociology, and philosophy of science with policy studies to examine the social context of science and technology.

### 11. Ecological Economics
   - Crosses economics, ecology, and political science to address the sustainability of ecosystems and economies.

### 12. Digital Humanities
   - Converges humanities with computing technologies to analyze and interpret cultural and social phenomena.

### 13. Peace and Conflict Studies
   - Incorporates political science, sociology, psychology, international relations, and ethics to understand and resolve conflicts peacefully.

### 14. Computational Social Science
   - Combines computer science with social sciences to analyze complex social systems and human behavior.

### 15. Integrative Medicine
   - Melds conventional Western medicine with alternative and complementary therapies to treat the whole person, not just the disease.

### 16. Health Informatics
   - Fuses information science, computer science, and health care to optimize the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of information in health and biomedicine.

### 17. Social Entrepreneurship
   - Combines business, innovation, and social science to develop sustainable solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues.

### 18. Synthetic Biology
   - Merges biology, engineering, genetics, chemistry, and computer science to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems.

### 19. Human-Computer Interaction
   - Integrates design, computer science, psychology, and ergonomics to create user-friendly interfaces and technology.

### 20. Food Systems Studies
   - Blends agriculture, nutrition, environmental science, economics, and sociology to understand and improve food production, distribution, and consumption.

### 21. Disaster Risk Reduction
   - Combines geography, environmental science, sociology, engineering, and emergency management to mitigate and prepare for disasters.

### 22. Media Studies
   - Integrates communications, sociology, psychology, and cultural studies to understand the impact of media on society.

### 23. Cybersecurity
   - Joins computer science, information technology, law, and ethics to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack or unauthorized access.

### 24. Quantum Computing
   - Combines quantum physics, computer science, mathematics, and information theory to develop computers based on quantum-mechanical phenomena.

### 25. Space Studies
   - Unites astronomy, physics, engineering, and earth sciences to explore and study outer space.

Transdisciplinary fields are inherently dynamic and adaptive, often evolving with societal needs and scientific advancements. They reflect the interconnectedness of knowledge and the necessity of collaborative problem-solving in the face of complex global challenges.
