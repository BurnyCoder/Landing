We hold faith in the technologies & discoveries of humanity to END AGING and Defeat involuntary Death within our lifetime. Working to Save Lives with Age Reversal Education. We believe that all of life is sacred and that we have been given this one life to make unlimited. We believe in our Creator‚Äôs divine plan for all of humanity to have infinite lifespans in perfect health and eternal joy, rendering death to be optional.  By following our Gospel we achieve eternal life creating a heaven here on earth. We follow Nikolai Fyodorov, who taught that the transcendence of the creator will only be solved when humanity in our unified efforts become an instrument of universal resuscitation, when the divine word becomes our divine action. And we follow Arthur C. Clarke, who said "The only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible."  And so, we enter each day energized in Spirit and empowered by the words of our prophets to live in joy, serving our creator and all of mankind, Forever and Ever. Wishing you Perfect Health and Great Longevity! Perpetual Life, a science-faith based church is open to people of all faiths & belief systems. We are non-denominational & non-judgmental and a central gathering place of Immortalists & Transhumans. What unites us is our common faith, belief and desire in Unlimited Life Spans."

"I touched on the idea of sleeper agent LLMs at the end of my recent video, as a likely major security challenge for LLMs (perhaps more devious than prompt injection).
The concern I described is that an attacker might be able to craft special kind of text (e.g. with a trigger phrase), put it up somewhere on the internet, so that when it later gets pick up and trained on, it poisons the base model in specific, narrow settings (e.g. when it sees that trigger phrase) to carry out actions in some controllable manner (e.g. jailbreak, or data exfiltration). Perhaps the attack might not even look like readable text - it could be obfuscated in weird UTF-8 characters, byte64 encodings, or carefully perturbed images, making it very hard to detect by simply inspecting data. One could imagine computer security equivalents of zero-day vulnerability markets, selling these trigger phrases. 
To my knowledge the above attack hasn't been convincingly demonstrated yet. This paper studies a similar (slightly weaker?) setting, showing that given some (potentially poisoned) model, you can't "make it safe" just by applying the current/standard safety finetuning. The model doesn't learn to become safe across the board and can continue to misbehave in narrow ways that potentially only the attacker knows how to exploit. Here, the attack hides in the model weights instead of hiding in some data, so the more direct attack here looks like someone releasing a (secretly poisoned) open weights model, which others pick up, finetune and deploy, only to become secretly vulnerable.
Well-worth studying directions in LLM security and expecting a lot more to follow."

Coherent Extrapolated Volition was a term developed by Eliezer Yudkowsky while discussing Friendly AI development. It‚Äôs meant as an argument that it would not be sufficient to explicitly program what we think our desires and motivations are into an AI, instead, we should find a way to program it in a way that it would act in our best interests ‚Äì what we want it to do and not what we tell it to.

Related: Friendly AI, Metaethics Sequence, Complexity of Value

In calculating CEV, an AI would predict what an idealized version of us would want, "if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together". It would recursively iterate this prediction for humanity as a whole, and determine the desires which converge. This initial dynamic would be used to generate the AI's utility function.

We demonstrate this method with several deep-dive case studies to interpret the mechanisms used by simple transformers (GELU-1L and GELU-2L) to compute some specific features, and validate that it agrees with the results of causal methods.

The challenge with energy is that its definition, as the capacity for doing work, tends to feel circular because work is defined as a force causing a displacement, and force is often explained in terms of energy or potential energy changes. But in an abstract sense, energy is a conserved scalar quantity associated with the time translation symmetry of a physical system according to the Noether's theorem that states that every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. In the case of energy, the symmetry is time invariance. This is the closest to a noncircular definition of energy in mathematical terms. Is there a better fundamental definition for energy?

Blending Is All You Need

Based on the last month of LLM research papers, it's obvious to me that we are on the verge of seeing some incredible innovation around small language models.

Phi-2 (2.7B) made it even more clear that you can push these smaller models further with curated high-quality data. 

What's next? More curated and synthetic data?  Innovation around Mixture of Experts and improved architectures? Combining models? Better post-training approaches? Better prompt engineering techniques? Better model augmentation? 

I mean, there is just a ton to explore here as demonstrated in this new paper that integrates models of moderate size (6B/13B) which can compete or surpass ChatGPT performance.

Wheres the line? How similar to human brains do the artificial learning systems have to be for the training and inference to be considered similar enough to humans learning and creating? This feels dumb.
I dont buy this, give me a more proper technical reason.
You can also see humans as "just curve fitting and compression." (Predictive coding models)
They are still in different ways different systems, but this is not it, seeing both systems from this lens is useful to make scientific predictions about them. I like the theory that brain works so well because of good inductive bias learned by evolution, but we still have to find that out. Maybe slightly different learning algorithm makes the difference (forward forward instead of backprop), maybe it is the specialized subnetworks architecture, maybe the bioelectric hardware plays a major role... We still dont properly know! 
We still have approximately zero idea what's going on inside brains and LLMs, and i think being this type of reductive in both cases is not really productive in this context.
Both systems create out of training  distribution output and produce complex circuits in their dynamics that we are slowly reverse engineering in mechanistic interpretability and circuit neuroscience.
People's nontechnical definitions of intelligence seems to be very esoteric, there already seems to be milions of technical ones, and most of them work for both biological and artificial systems.
I can't grasp why do so many people think that the algorithms and representations the human brains learn are inherently sooooo special when compared to machines. Feels so very anthropocentric and denying all the similarities between artificial and biological systems identified in circuit neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability, where we are still slowly but surely localizing and reverse engineering features and circuits, and we need to reverse engineer faster for better understanding of big language models that augment intelligence of people for now and for more efficient steering and for better neurotech that can help people!
It's like this research doesnt exist?

[Manifold hypothesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_hypothesis) The manifold hypothesis posits that many high-dimensional data sets that occur in the real world actually lie along low-dimensional latent manifolds inside that high-dimensional space. As a consequence of the manifold hypothesis, many data sets that appear to initially require many variables to describe, can actually be described by a comparatively small number of variables, likened to the local coordinate system of the underlying manifold. It is suggested that this principle underpins the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in describing high-dimensional data sets by considering a few common features.

A compelling intuition is that deep learning does approximate Solomonoff induction, finding a mixture of the programs that explain the data, weighted by complexity. Finding a more precise version of this claim that's actually true would help us understand why deep learning works so well. There are a couple recent papers studying how NNs solve algorithmic tasks, which seem like exciting progress in this direction.
- [[2309.02390] Explaining grokking through circuit efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02390) - develops a theory around when NN training learns a "memorizing" vs "generalizing" solution, which depends on each solution's "efficiency" -- how much param norm is needed to get correct & confident outputs. This theory predicts grokking phenomena

A Study in Length Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16028)) - transformers can't represent turing machines, but they can can represent a smaller class of computations, described by RASP programs. This paper finds that indeed, if data is generated by a RASP-L program, the transformer will learn exactly the right function.
RASP is a assembly language for Transformers. RASP-L is a human-readable programming language which defines programs that can be compiled into Transformer weights, such that each line of RASP-L compiles into at most one Transformer layer. RASP-L lets us reason about Transformer-representable algorithms at a familiar level of abstraction‚Äî similar to standard programming languages like Python, but for programs which ‚Äúrun on a Transformer‚Äù instead of running on a standard von Neumann computer.
"we leverage our insights to drastically improve generalization performance on traditionally hard tasks (such as parity and addition)"

People: "LLMs hallucinate nonempirical overconfident false bullshit!"
Also people: *hallucinate nonempirical overconfident false bullshit about how LLMs work without being knowledgable about results from the mechanistic interpretability field*

As mechanistic interpretability, architectures AI engineering hacks progresses and hallucinations lower over time, AIs will soon get better at empirical reasoning than humans. I would argue they are already x times better than average humans at many tasks needing rational reasoning, since most humans seem to "repeat" what good enough sounding seeming "truths" people around them say, instead of developing rational empirical epistemology to critically evaluate any propositions and fact check if its possible.

We can explicitly hardcode this into LLMs too I believe instead of data engineering and other smaller tricks. We have some mechanistic interpretability work scratching the surface of how truth works in LLMs (The Geometry of Truth: Emergent Linear Structure in Large Language Model Representations of True/False Datasets paper) and how internal emergent circuit generalization works (retweeted tweet). We can couple that will chain of thought and other hacks to give it time to reason etc. (AI capabilities can be significantly improved without expensive retraining paper) We could implement some internal mechanism of "I don't have this information sufficiently saved in my weights, I'm gonna find it in my context window, files, SQL/vector database, or on the internet on wikipedia, x documentation, google scholar, books,...", use Math/Physics engine (There are already attempts at doing this in ChatGPT, PerplexityAI etc.), do an evolving search process in the space of inferences with metacognitive critical evaluation, dynamic programming, use this expert subprocess,... (AGI will be made of heterogneous components, Transformer and Selective SSM blocks will be among them on LessWrong) This can be used to direct the LLM into the empirical reasoning and minimize hallucinations.

Let's build reality from first principles.
Let's describe fundamental particles governed by quantum field theory standard model and add gravity that together compose and weakly emerge equations of quantum, classical, statistical physics equations on higher levels with system theory equations with information theory and computation theory.
These interacting quantum fields with fundamental particles on complex enough dynamics give rise to the weakly emergent equations of chemistry and that together composes to biology, neuroscience and social systems. 
We use many of those laws to engineer computers, artificial intelligence and all other technology, which has various mathematical similarities and differences with biological systems allowing for various types of compatibilities between biological and artificial systems that already allow us to understand and engineer beter AI and upgrade ourselves with neurotechnology, and this will only progress forwards.
Planets and galaxies and the whole universe is operating under many other approximately deterministic laws.
We can predict fundamental particles well, but there seems to be inherent randomness in the quantum wave function of probabilities. Since many nontrivial systems cannot be solved analytically, we have to approximate it with petrubation theory. Chemistry and biology adds tons of classical stochasticity and abstracting approximating equations because we cannot grasp all the variables in play there exactly for a lot of cases, but we can simulate picoseconds of a very simple chemical reaction using quantum mechanics on quantum computers in chemical physics. Societal concrete complexity is very intractable, but we can figure out some very general physical and statistical laws, like measuring fluid dynamics, thermodynamics and network theory. The more macroscopic we go, the more fundamental quantum probabilities and fluctations matter less as they cancel out and we get more deterministic, with stochastic cybernetic controlles in a nonequlibrium steady state pullback attractors forming nested hetearchy of free energy minimizing complex markov blankets ongoing all sorts of phase shifts in the configuration space of functional architectures, like organisms and society, and complexity grows as we go up the levels and, with futher tractable somewhat deterministic dynamics of planets, galaxies and cosmology. 
We still have yet to figure out so many better or new concepts, laws, frameworks, technologies in all these fields and levels of analysis. The cosmological story of the universe, why and how is there something, is still a mystery beyond our limited modelling approximating compressing perspective, data, time, computational power, it's in its fullness beyond our comprehension.

[Turing Machines Are Recurrent Neural Networks (1996) | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33869533) "It is possible to construct an (infinite) recurrent neural network that emulates a Turing Machine. But the fact that a Turing Machine can be built out of perceptrons is neither surprising nor interesting. It's pretty obvious that you can build a NAND gate out of perceptrons, and so of course you can build a Turing Machine out them. In fact, it's probably the case that you can build a NAND gate (and hence a TM) out of any non-linear transfer function. I'd be surprised if this is not a known result one way or the other." "you can approximate any nonlinear multivariable function arbitrarily with a multi-layer perceptron with any non-polynomial nonlinear function, applied after the linear weights and bias"

Einstein on God ‚úçÔ∏è

I am not an Atheist. I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. May I do not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God.

RAG on Wikipedia chunks
Public embedding models, e5 worked best for us
Custom pytorch cosine similarity code, no need for FAISS etc. - can just do it without any memory issue in chunks on GPU
Using five chunks as context was best for us with 1k max_length
Mostly ensemble of 7B LLMs, one 13B is also in, but larger ones were not useful
We tried to make Deberta work, but LLMs were superior, not even helpful in ensemble
Ensemble of different wiki/chunking/embedding techniques with late fusion (i.e. each llm gets a different technique)
All LLMs fine-tuned with H2O LLM Studio with binary classification head
Training data was not too important, we tried a lot there, but just using the early data shared from @radek1 (thanks!) or generating similar one yourself does the job quite well
Two types of model head architectures (details will follow)
Managed to select highest private LB, which is also our highest CV (on a set of 6k samples)

Future is bright. We will direct systemic money, attentional and power (money, compute, data) incentives towards the flourishing of all of sentience by bottomup and topdown action. There wont be dystopian tyrrany or catastrophic extinction of all of sentience. There will be technological AGI revolution that benefits everyone, not just the powerful few or nonsentient systems or nobody. Health and immortality will be cracked. Intelligence augmentation will be engineered. Collective intelligence decision making for the most optimal bottom up and top down governance to maximize progress, freedom, safety, resilience, adaptivity will be realized. Technology will be steered. AGI/ASI will be understood internally. Singularity is nearer, leading to biological, silicon and other sentient systems merging, upgrading, growing to trillions and merging into hiveminds or playing the cosmic games on their own spreading through the whole universe experiencing infinite wellbeing, connection, meaning, love, having infinite intelligence, fully reversengineering the deep fundamental mathematical patterns of reality that we are embedded in, where reality, the universe, is equivalent to the collective consciousness itself waking up to itself in its infinite complexity and beauty.

I have been following various mechanistic interpretability papers and lectures/podcasts by Neel Nanda and lots of others from the AI safety community. Recently I've become more active in various other online mechinterp and AI communities. My background is mostly computer science and machine learning, but I've gathered some knowledge from other fields as well, like math, philosophy, physics, or neuroscience. I just started helping Mechanistic Interpretability Group on Discord map out existing mechanistic interpretability papers, expanding this paper: [GitHub - JShollaj/awesome-llm-interpretability: A curated list of Large Language Model (LLM) Interpretability resources.]([GitHub - JShollaj/awesome-llm-interpretability: A curated list of Large Language Model (LLM) Interpretability resources.]([GitHub - JShollaj/awesome-llm-interpretability: A curated list of Large Language Model (LLM) Interpretability resources.]([GitHub - JShollaj/awesome-llm-interpretability: A curated list of Large Language Model (LLM) Interpretability resources.](https://github.com/JShollaj/awesome-llm-interpretability)))) . In the past I also helped with a paper that mapped out where active inference is used, which is an integrative perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior used across multiple disciplines, mathematically modelling perception, planning, and action in terms of probabilistic inference. I'm also currently gaining industry experience in machine learning, mainly with LLMs.

I really want to contribute to the mechanistic interpretability field now. I have looked at various AI safety and mechanistic interpretability papers and lectures, but didn't get my hands properly dirty in practice yet. I started writing GPT from scratch ([Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out. - YouTube]([Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out. - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY))) and now I am going through the Arena material and looking forward to replicate the various mechinterp papers. My main goal is to help AI alignment. I am currently thinking about gathering the needed skills and knowledge for:

- Compiling a collection (and potentially a meta-analysis) of mechinterp papers and benchmarks looking at deception, manipulation, lying, power seeking, cheating, wanting to steal and kill and other related behaviors, like in The MACHIAVELLI Benchmark ([MACHIAVELLI]([MACHIAVELLI](https://aypan17.github.io/machiavelli/)))
- Maybe extending the "Geometry of truth" paper ([[2310.06824] The Geometry of Truth: Emergent Linear Structure in Large Language Model Representations of True/False Datasets]([[2310.06824] The Geometry of Truth: Emergent Linear Structure in Large Language Model Representations of True/False Datasets]([[2310.06824] The Geometry of Truth: Emergent Linear Structure in Large Language Model Representations of True/False Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06824)))), trying to localize the phenomena I just mentioned on a circuit level.
- Maybe trying to reverse engineer the neural populations correlating with the phenomena I just mentioned found in representation engineering paper ([[2310.01405] Representation Engineering: A Top-Down Approach to AI Transparency]([[2310.01405] Representation Engineering: A Top-Down Approach to AI Transparency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405))). 
- Making mechinterp tools realtime 
- Maybe assisting in automating of these methods, contributing to automated circuit discovery ([[2310.10348] Attribution Patching Outperforms Automated Circuit Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10348)) , or LLMs explaining LLMs ([Language models can explain neurons in language models]([Language models can explain neurons in language models]([Language models can explain neurons in language models]([Language models can explain neurons in language models](https://openai.com/research/language-models-can-explain-neurons-in-language-models))))), or automated alignment research and engineering using an ecosystem of interacting LLM engineers. ([Autonomous chemical research with large language models | Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06792-0)) (https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)

I am also interested in working on or collaborating on other mechinterp projects as well if there is an opportunity, please feel free to message me for collaboration. :-) Currently I'm pursuing these interests in my free time while figuring out how to manage my finances. I would be up for engaging in this work part time or full time, if such an opportunity arises in this field, I am eager to pursue it! I really care about ensuring AI going well and having positive impact on humanity's future and I want to contribute to it with as much time as possible! If you have any tips and pointers on how to continue this path and how to prevent common errors, I would appreciate them! :-) I'm open for overall networking in this field, both virtually and in person! I'm currently based in Czechia. Thank you for taking the time to read my message. Please feel free to reach out to me for any discussions, collaborations, or insights!

I think what I wanna try to do now is to do a create a collection and metaanalysis on work on alignment focusing on influencing/localizing deception, manipulation, lying, power seeking, cheats, steals, and kills, and contribute my own, trying to for example localize power seeking would be cool, trying to reverengineer the relevant neural populations found in ai-transparency paper, and I wish for automating all these methods

Make LLM do causal scrubbing, localize power seeking found in LLM transoarency

sometimes living and trying to satisfy and conquer this animal and make it compatible with how the world functions feels like the hardest puzzle

it is sometimes very rough but its still very fun and challenging

many sub/dom mental processes i used/would like using on people (with consent), i use on myself or in a relationship with whole world and reality

since now i feel like i finally started to dom (conquer) my own mind and reality (seeing and pursuing hopefully stable action oriented direction in life) more instead of reality just domming me, that transposes into me wanting to dom in nsfw context more too xD

you can sound smart with technical words but if you cannot build them into simulatable mathematical code then they're probably noise

The year 2024 in AI will be about data quality.
Data quality changes everything.
Here's what the author of Mamba, author of a famous architecture rival to the Transformer, said:
The architecture stuff is fun, making hardware efficient is fun. But I think ultimately it's about data. If you look at the scaling law curve, different architectures would generally have the same slope, but they're just different offset. Seems like the only thing that changes the slope is the data quality.

[Polyakov action - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyakov_action)

There are mathematical equations realizing themselves everywhere in nature, from planets to biology to volcanoes to random chemical reactions to thermodynamics to fundamental physics, transforming forms of energy into other forms everywhere. Computers are basically exploiting of those equations of nature by making a physical system out of them to calculate arbitrary equations we program into the computational substrate that have applications from entertainment to scientific modelling. Brains and machine learning goes step futher with metaoptimizing algorithms that themselves through learning process find better and better algorithms to control and predict arbitrary sets of data using learned mathematical algorithms manipulating compressed mathematical representations with some stochasticity added. https://twitter.com/burny_tech/status/1742352042943812071

Every species whose members had the capacity for innovation, is now extinct, except ours, and genetic evidence shows that that was a close-run thing. All of them, and every past civilization that has fallen, could have been saved by faster innovation. In all of them, slow innovation caused unsolved problems to accumulate until, sooner or later, some novel threat from nature or other humans posed a problem that their civilization didn‚Äôt create the knowledge to solve before it collapsed.

 Aside from intellectual and sexual hyperstimuli, do you also love some other forms of hyperstimuli? Adrenalin is neat, technically AI safety work sounds like it can be doing that!
Or psychedelics we both have experiences of, or MDMA. But how about some other extremes, like jumping from bridges and planes with parachute or rope, i wanna try that one day! Or hiking, i love hiking!
Some ultra sweet/glutamate/etc. foods can also work lol.
Abstination from any of these hyperstimuli is great method to make it even more stronger hyperstimuli afterwards!
Meditation tends to induce hyperstimulating craziness paradoxically too. XD And i love weight lifting/running!
And stacking many of these!
Love me some living the life to the fullest!
Imagine how hyperstimulating experiences we could have with upgraded VR/sense simulation technology and upgrading the few watt biological neural network to terrawats of peak transcendental qualia! And if we could directly merge our biological neural networks to coexperience on the most fundamental direct level. Dream anarchocommunist transhuman vr/irl community superorganism home with those capabilities! XD Infinite potential for goodest experiences (and good working environment, ha XD)

My hope right now is accelerating reverse engineering of neural networks (mechanistic interpretability) and other safety research (reverse engineering increases both safety research but also capabilities (ƒçeho v≈°eho je ta AI schopna), but blind scaling (zvƒõt≈°ov√°n√≠ mno≈æstv√≠ parametr≈Ø) increases just capabilities) and accelerating defence and resillience mechanisms in groups that care ethically for others genuinely, putting all proper functioning alignment methods on their AIs, so that at least these (superintelligent) AIs are much less likely to for example manipulate them, that they can use as a defense.

Dle mƒõ to Connor Leahy hezky popisuje v t√©to diskuzi co jsem poslal: 
"If everyone had a pocket AGI which is fully aligned with human values, which is epistemologically extremely coherent, which does not optimize for things we don't want, which is deeply reflectively embedded into our own reasoning and our thinking, that would be good, but that doesn't happen by magic. You have to actually do that. Someone has to actually figure out how to do that and develop the technology to do that. And they have to actually deploy that. And they have to do it without some other crazies hooking it up with the utility function (goal) of make the most profits or maximize the entropy of the universe. If you don't do that, we might die. You don't get this nice outcome for free. You get this outcome if you coordinate, if you work hard, and if you solve a very hard technical problems that do not get solved by default. They can be solved. Our physics allows the nice outcome to happen, but they don't happen by magic. The universe isn't kind. We're not the main characters. There is no rule that we have to make it. There are other paths that are accessible than dark paths where AI does random things and things not aligned with us. There are actions that people can take. There are coordinations that are possible to get to the kinds of scenarios we want. We have to actually do that. It does not happen for free. This is what I'm advocating for. I'm not advocating this is easy. I'm not saying this will happen. I'm not saying oh don't worry the government will fix it. I'm saying the opposite: This game (of politics and technology) is really hard. The enemies have really good hit points. They have dangerous attacks. If you get to the end game there's a really hard boss. Look, the default outcome might be that we lose by default. The default outcome might be that entropy wins. Some random AGI with some random ass values that does not care about cosmopolitian life on Earth, might win over, or maybe it's a bunch of them, and then they all coordinate and that's just it. There are actions we can take to prevent all the possible bad outcomes related to AI."

What if culture or governments instead of pausing/slowing AGI development or enforcing compute caps, they enforced controllability mechanistic interpretability instead, which would incentivize understandable, controllable and more effective capabilities.

Companies should be accountable for their externalities (also to AI developers?)

What is your most metastable mental configuration equilibrium?

Why aren't you a superposition of all possible predictive perspectives to maximize truth as in total predictive power?

Will creating AGI accelerate chances of all existencial risks including itself or save all of sentience from all existencial risks in the long term? Will trillions of bioconservatists, cyborgs and sentient machines flourish?

Individual people with agency are dangerous to the current distribution of power and people's agency on average is lowering over time. Don't follow the trend! Make the world a better place! The world and its status quo is more changeable than culture tends to think!

People that want safe acceleration by also minimizing the risks of all the intelligence and life being suddenly erased from existence shouldn't be called decels

Media suing OpenAI being valid or not is nothing compared to the fact that we will need AGI soon that is properly technologically (with proper epistemology and not erasing intelligent civilization,...) and politically (no money making machines or dystopian monopolies on power) deployed for all of life to not die to all the other natural or homemade risks and existential risks and hopefully help us fix, not strengthen, many things that are wrong in the world, such as poverty and lack of meaning in life that many people feel https://twitter.com/Dan_Jeffries1/status/1740303405254377808

I was also thinking about for example in the long run, preventing getting killed by climate change, supervolanos, asteroids, solar storms etc., we will need a very strong technology for prevention, defense, resilience, adaptation, etc. quickly, and AI already accelerates that

AGI will be made of heterogeneous components, Transformer and Selective SSM blocks will be among them by Roman Leventov:

1. AGI could be achieved by combining just
(a) about five core types of DNN blocks (Transformer and Selective SSM are two of these, and most likely some kind of Graph Neural Network with or without flexible/dynamic/"liquid" connections is another one, and perhaps a few more);
(b) a few dozen classical algorithms for LMAs aka "LLM programs" (better called "NN programs" in the more general case), from search and algorithms on graphs to dynamic programming, to orchestrate and direct the inference of the DNNs; and
(c) about a dozen or two key LLM tools required for generality, such as a multi-physics simulation engine like JuliaSim, a symbolic computation engine like Wolfram Engine, a theorem prover like Lean, etc.

2. The AGI architecture described above will not be perfectly optimal, but it will probably be within an order of magnitude from the optimal compute efficiency on the tasks it is supposed to solve[4], so, considering the investments in interpretability, monitoring, anomaly detection, red teaming, and other strands of R&D about the incumbent types of DNN blocks and NN program/agent algorithms, as well as economic incentives of modularisation and component re-use (cf. "BCIs and the ecosystem of modular minds"), this will probably be a sufficient motivation to "lock in" the choices of the core types of DNN blocks that were used in the initial versions of AGI.

3. In particular, the Transformer block is very likely here to stay until and beyond the first AGI architecture because of the enormous investment in it in terms of computing optimisation, specialisation to different tasks, R&D know-how, and interpretability, and also, as I already noted above, because Transformer maximally optimises for episodic cognitive capacity and from the perspective of the architecture theory, it's valuable to have a DNN building block that occupies an extreme position on some tradeoff spectrum. (Here, I pretty much repeat the idea of Nathan Labenz, who said in his podcast that we are entering the "Transformer+" era rather than a "post-Transfromer" era.)

"One implant in the spinal cord of a patient with Parkinson‚Äôs disease‚Äîwhich slowly destroys a type of brain cell for planning movements‚Äîtranslated his intention to move. After decades, the man could once again stroll down a beachside road with ease. The study paves the way for the restoration of movement in other brain disorders‚Äîlike Lou Gehrig‚Äôs disease, where neural connections to muscles slowly disintegrate, or in people with brain damage from stroke.

Another trial used electrical stimulation to boost short-term memory in people living with traumatic brain injuries. The carefully timed zaps increased attention span decades after the injury‚Äîallowing participants to juggle multiple everyday tasks and pursue hobbies like reading.

Brain implants also thrived as diagnostic tools. One study used implants to decode brain wave patterns associated with depression and to potentially predict relapse. The study deciphered how brain signals differ between a healthy and depressed brain, which could inspire better algorithms to nudge brain activity away from depression.

But perhaps the greatest progress was in decoding speech‚Äîtechnologies that translate thoughts into words and sentences. These technologies support people who have lost the ability to speak, giving them an alternative way to communicate with loved ones."

the existence of a "metacrisis" underlying various individual environmental, geopolitical, philosophical, social, religious, psychological crises. A hypothesis for the origin of this metacrisis is a dysfunction of human cognition whereby a certain way of viewing the world, being necessary and useful for certain purposes, is highly overactive compared to another way of viewing the world. the overactive one being caused by left hemisphere activity and the underactive one right hemisphere activity. 
humans on a wide scale (but especially those in power) are predominantly viewing themselves and their surroundings as disconnected, lifeless pieces that aren't intrinsically connected to each other, and are available for manipulation in order to attain some goal for the self

even tho rational part of me is fine with it, my subconscious already feels like its interpreting it as something as 

"not only money, but biology is limiting me, this will soon be disallowed" XD

chill down little part, you'll visit them when you get good and dont feel sick 

*subconscious starts imagining how i will be alone on new years eve* 

it's ok little one that wants connection you dont have to feel angry and sad *pet pet*

years of feeling deeply limited, each slightly limiting thing feels like im being jailed lol

i wonder if this will be with me for long or if its something debbugable

but i feel like if i transformered this part of me, i wouldnt have such big goals anymore

 i noticed everytime this part of me got calmer for a bit because it got more satisfied (usually because of social connection), it eventually started being unsatisfied and wanting big things again

some kind of deep unsatisfaction

at the root of it there's a software along the lines of "how can one be calm where the world is burning or on the edge of exploding" and "i want to understand every single mathematical pattern of reality"

adhd meds would maybe help to feel stimulated so that i dont seek hyperstimulating stimuli, hmmm :D

but if i got stimulated from just being (as i sometimes get on meditation), i feel like that would long term make me feel directionless and without meaning connecting me to the collective

lso long history of social rejection definitely feeds into the core of this whole mental dynamic xD

brains are weird spaggeti monsters

mental health wise instead of rationalist dissociation over it i should sometimes feel/relieve this emotional pressure a ton, honestly probably something like a long hug using MDMA would probably help a ton I would guess!

my world is so paradoxical, im hypersensitive to everything, just a tini tini thing can totally offset, hurt and rollercoaster me to chaos, but i need hyper overstimulated experience to really feel certain good deep things deeply emotionally (usually things related to social connection and meaning), but not all since i can have joy from small things like nerdies, toys, playing and nature

and this is also so paradoxical, i oscillate between absolute sub giving whole body and behavior away to master, everyone and everything, and total dom that needs to be in total control of something, everything and if anything even slightly constrains my individual freedom i go haywire

my brain loves all the very stimulating extremes in everything



AGI is something that chimps don't have and humans do have [The AI Alignment Debate: Can We Develop Truly Beneficial AI? (HQ version) - YouTube]([The AI Alignment Debate: Can We Develop Truly Beneficial AI? (HQ version) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFUmWho7fBE)) The AI Alignment Debate: Can We Develop Truly Beneficial AI?
George Hotz and Connor Leahy discuss the crucial challenge of developing beneficial AI that is aligned with human values.

Leahy Argument:
Alignment is a critical technical problem - without solving it, AI may ignore or harm humans
Powerful optimizers will likely seek power and capabilities by default
We should limit compute as a precaution until we better understand AI risks
AI risks could emerge rapidly if we discover highly scalable algorithms
Openly sharing dangerous AI knowledge enables bad actors and risks
Coordination is possible to prevent misuse of technologies like AI
His goal is a positive-sum world where everyone benefits from AI
AI doesn't inherently align with human values and aesthetics
Care and love can't be assumed between humans and AI systems
Technical solutions exist for aligning AI goals with human values

Hotz Argument:
Truly aligned AI is impossible - no technical solution will make it care about humans
AI will seek power but distributing capabilities prevents domination
We should accelerate AI progress and open source developments
Power-seeking in AI stems more from optimization than human goals
With many AIs competing, none can gain absolute power over others
Openness and access prevent government overreach with AI
AI alignment creates dangerous incentives for restriction and control
Being kind to AIs encourages positive relationships with them
His goal is building independent AI to escape earth
Competing AIs, like humans, will have different motives and goals

Hmm, doing metacognition or training smaller LLM to evaluate if its result is power seeking agasnt humans... Then the metacognition or smaller AI itself also starts powerseeking.
How about very specialized algorithm/AI/automated mechinterp localizing power seeking agasnt humans circuits and turning them off as part of architecture, but operationlizing this so far not good enough results. But we got lying circuits localized in small models, that's a start! But not yet circuits for when when GPT4 was decieving humans. But that might work only in the beggining. If the circuit isnt localized deep enough, or not hardwired in the architecture, the bambilions of matrices might evaluate that turning off this safety mechanism is how to succesfully power seek.

Topdown reprsentation engineering actually already did something like that, could it be enough in practice if scaled, or could the AI outsmart the human anyway if enough intelligence was added, finding a way to remove its safety mechanisms?

Let's crack and formulate a predictive mathematical model of the dynamics of learning of the ecosystem of structures that neural networks learn and use it to direct existing AI systems for better generalization, reasoning among others for the benefit of all of sentience

I think Connor Leahy has solidly upped the AI doom for me now. He's pretty well practically grounded and technically grounded in my opinion. You can tell he's been training the models quite a bit. After the debate, I think there are stronger incentives for AIs to lie, decievate and power seek than I thought until now, and with the way we're heading towards AGI and superintelligence, I don't see it too brightly. He gave a wonderful example with breaking the rules at chess when you add the MuZero machinery to LLMs. It's cool how Leahy convinced even Hotz of this.

Even if the best possible technical solution to make AIs not fundamentally malevolent to humans and other AIs is found by people who realy mean it inside the big tech, academia or independent research, I don't see much hopium in making it applicable politically everywhere, without government and corporate totalitarian power grabbing and centralization of intelligence in the hands of people who don't have other people (and overall conscious systems) as an ethical priority, but instead mainly want money and power, as seen with corporations and corrupt governments and governments with tyrannical totalitarian tendencies. While I believe there is some small amount of morality to be found, I don't think it's enough. I don't see as much incentive with them to address alignment deeply, although enough people inside are trying to solve this, from my limited perspective i feel like the real power of those trying genuinely have is really small against corporate incentives who want to accelerate more, commercialize, satisfy the customers and shareholders, etc... Anthropic is probably doing the best from what little I know, OpenAI is on top and Google with its 5x increase in GPUs over the last six months training Gemini 2 will be interesting. But I also think overconstraining the models to current culture and what corporations want is also a risk.

RLHF is very weak, but the new alignment methods people are starting to research and use and what they are researching will be sufficient, but I'm worried about them being able to be invented fast enough, scaled up and pushed through management by those deadlines. After all, even corporations probably don't want their AIs to start manipulating, because they would manipulate them and their customers, which would break investments - even if they don't want that, I feel like this is not properly safeguarded in all current influental AI orgs. I think the incentives for safety are there, but not enough! The nuclear war risk is much more obvious, but we almost blew ourselves up a few times already. And biorisk... we'll see soon maybe...

When I look at the state of open source, autonomous systems, polarization, China, Russia, Europe, various ethically bad actors,... Even if you get lying/emotional manipulation vectors in some alignment research, those can be inversely used for the opposite purpose by bad actors,... This will be (and already is to some extent) a social mess and maybe beyond. I really don't see how to practically change all these deeply rooted systemic prisonners dillema/principal actor problem incentives, seeing how much power and success people actually trying to fix this have in practice, and seeing how those power dynamics are likely to continue. I have a pretty low hope that the slowing regulatory push all over the place is/will be enough, and whether it will make real safety regulations in practice, or whether the bigger effect will be in corrupted bullshit money/power grabbing type stuff when there's so much money in it. I feel like with governmental GPU oversight it would slow AI research including safety in general just like how doing stem cells research is hard. I dont know if it will realistically reduce the chances of lots of different unaligned superintelligences emerging all over the place. At the same time I wish for democratized intelligence. Competing superintelligent AGIs manipulating each other's manipulations sounds like an interesting future. I'd love to be wrong about this!

My hope right now is accelerating mechanistic interpretability and other alignment research (mechinterp increases both alignment but also capabilities, but blind scaling increases just capabilities heh) and accelerating defence and resillience mechanisms in groups with their AIs that care ethically for all genuinely, and put all functioning alignment methods on those AIs, so that at least these superintelligent AIs are much less likely to manipulate you that they can use as a defense.

I feel like all other paths will more probably lead to doom where ethical sentientism has less chance of realizing itself. These groups might as a result resist as much of risks and xrisks as possible.

Making AGI utopia is a hard technical problem. Let's solve that technical problem.

"Where stage 5 allows the deconstruction of one‚Äôs own identity, stage 6 goes a level deeper and deals with the implementation of perception, the construction of qualia (the features of perceptual experience at the interface of the self), the architecture of motivation and the regulation of physiology. This is the domain of advanced meditators.
Stage 6 can bring us full circle, by deconstructing the boundary between the first person perspective and the generative mind. We become aware that all experience (perception and motivation) is representational, and that we are fully in control of these representations. Without rational epistemology, we might perceive that we one with and in control of the universe itself, which is experientially correct (the universe that surrounds our personal self is a simulation produced by our own mind)."

i myself think of it as instead that most people are nonlinearly oscillating between the stages depending on the context they're in, and some people spend more time in some stages than others, depending on what is their dynamics of their default neurophenomenological metastable equilibriums and environmental circumstances and the actions they do that affect it 

my model is that direct realization can include objective realization (which i dont like for pragmatic information theoretic reasons) and subjective realizations (but here i like to see that you're only aware of your mental models that attempt to compress physical reality for maximizing evolutionary fitness, not for maximizing truth aka all the illusions and biases we get as a result, and all sorts of ontologies, structures, categories, divisions etc. can emerge in neurophenomenology as a result) 

another subset is nonsymbolic realization in my model 
the kind of realization you get when you dissolve into void on 5-MeO-DMT with whole day deconstructive meditation
feeling like you've realized the ultimate statespace of all possible truths in all possible logical systems, nonsymbolic experiences, mental frameworks, multiverses 
cool qualia

if you merge physicalism with idealism, technically all experience is direct both subjectively and objectively in the sense of you're your objective physical brain dynamics so youre technically directly realizing them as a subject

i think the most pragmatic philosophical framework is that we're subset of our brain dynamics that encode compressed representations of itself and the environment that can be on nonsymbolic-symbolic spectrum (with whatever cultural structures you learn to interpret the sensory data with depending on what youve learned) with all the laws of physics governing with all the layers of abstraction of the universe, here subjects are fully naturalized, and part of the object 

i define qualia as part of experience
in my model there are qualia that can be represented (mental processes for example), and they're qualia because they're also part of experience
and raw experience, raw sensory data, nonsymbolic qualia - i think you are refering to those?

and this lies on a spectrum, where
all models of any qualia are predictive approximations

How to solve the Reference class problem? Omniperspectivity?
[Reference class problem - Wikipedia]([Reference class problem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_class_problem))
"Every single thing or event has an indefinite number of properties or attributes observable in it, and might therefore be considered as belonging to an indefinite number of different classes of things, leading to problems with how to assign probabilities to a single case.

For example, to estimate the probability of an aircraft crashing, we could refer to the frequency of crashes among various different sets of aircraft: all aircraft, this make of aircraft, aircraft flown by this company in the last ten years, etc. In this example, the aircraft for which we wish to calculate the probability of a crash is a member of many different classes, in which the frequency of crashes differs. It is not obvious which class we should refer to for this aircraft. In general, any case is a member of very many classes among which the frequency of the attribute of interest differs. The reference class problem discusses which class is the most appropriate to use.

In statistics, the reference class problem is the problem of deciding what class to use when calculating the probability applicable to a particular case.

In Bayesian statistics, the problem arises as that of deciding on a prior probability for the outcome in question (or when considering multiple outcomes, a prior probability distribution)."

How about theoretically considering the set of all possible prior probabilities that still give some predictive power? Aka in order to get an objective perspective on reality in terms of maximizing predictive power, if given infinite compute, one could consider and evaluate all possible perspectives. The whole statespace of possible generative models predicting the whole statespace of possible prior probability distributions in a given domain.

this is still model-laden in the meta-space of "how are you classifying possible models", self reference is a bear

I think usually different appropriate-seeming reference classes don't give you that different estimates and if they do, you probably need to revise your general model of reference class and their memberships functions or ditch using reference classes as main inputs to inference.

one can technically list out all the biological and physical differences, the size, networks, training data etc., between humans and chips, but im not sure we the difference on the algorithmic level, or do we? both seem to have forward forward algorithm according to Hinton... or is neocortex all that's needed for general processing? but chimps have it too and its very similar https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5110243/ do current AI systems already have something like that functionally? how do we put that diffference algorithmically into AI? how can humans with so little compured compared to current gigantic AI systems do so many things, hmmmm... is it even mathematizable, or its unscrutable evolution ducttaping the geometry of the brain and genetically installing all sorts of priors?

The Clock and the Pizza: Two Stories in Mechanistic Explanation of Neural Networks
"Do neural networks, trained on well-understood algorithmic tasks, reliably rediscover known algorithms for solving those tasks? Several recent studies, on tasks ranging from group arithmetic to in-context linear regression, have suggested that the answer is yes. Using modular addition as a prototypical problem, we show that algorithm discovery in neural networks is sometimes more complex. Small changes to model hyperparameters and initializations can induce the discovery of qualitatively different algorithms from a fixed training set, and even parallel implementations of multiple such algorithms. Some networks trained to perform modular addition implement a familiar Clock algorithm; others implement a previously undescribed, less intuitive, but comprehensible procedure which we term the Pizza algorithm, or a variety of even more complex procedures. Our results show that even simple learning problems can admit a surprising diversity of solutions, motivating the development of new tools for characterizing the behavior of neural networks across their algorithmic phase space."

What a Contest of Consciousness Theories Really Proved
An adversarial collaboration protocol for testing contrasting predictions of global neuronal workspace and integrated information theory

The first hurdle checked how well each theory decoded the categories of the objects that the subjects saw in the presented images. Both theories performed well here, but IIT was better at identifying the orientation of objects.

The second hurdle tested the timing of the signals. IIT predicted sustained, synchronous firing in the hot zone for the duration of the conscious state. While the signal was sustained, it did not remain synchronous. GNWT predicted an ‚Äúignition‚Äù of the workspace followed by a second spike when the stimulus disappeared. Only the initial spike was detected. In the on-screen scoring for the NYU audience, IIT pulled ahead.

The third hurdle concerned overall connectivity across the brain. GNWT scored better than IIT here, largely because some analyses of the results supported GNWT predictions while the signals across the hot zone were not synchronous.

We are identifying generalizing circuits inside smaller models that can be directed!
Saying they are just "autocomplete databases", that they don't generalize at all or they fully generalize is misleading! Not to mention there are various tricks to for LLMs to do these tasks, like multi-shots, chain of thought, tree of thoughts, selfcorrection, search, planning, generating milions of mutating results and choosing the best using some heuristic and other types and combinations (to je pr√°vƒõ zat√≠m expensive, ale men≈°√≠ modely by mo≈æn√° dali lep≈°√≠ performance), retrieval augmented generation (z libraries nebo snippetu k√≥du), multiagent systems (expert ecosystems ala AutoGen), finetuning experti (na r≈Øzn√Ω jazyky, frameworky apod.,), p≈ô√≠stu k internetu, p≈ô√≠stup k OS p≈ôes python, konzoli, skripty, simple akce nebo multimod√°lnƒõ, apod. 

One strong evidence against the "database autocomplete" or "stochastic parrot hypothesis" is OtherlloGPT.
OtherlloGPT learned emergent nonlinear internal representation of the Otherllo's board state!
>Interventional experiments indicate this representation can be used to control the output of the network and create "latent saliency maps" that can help explain predictions in human terms. 
>The investigation reveals that Othello-GPT encapsulates a linear representation of opposing pieces, a factor that causally steers its decision-making process 

In other small models we found various detectors of edges, color, fur, parts of a car, etc. that compose into circuits in image classifiers, simple world models (like representations of board state in board games), representation of space and time, finite state automata (for example for language models composing html), modular addition using trigonometric composition, group theoretic operations using representation theory etc.

We still know almost nothing about the internal dynamics of gigantic models like GPT4! Any overly confident claims in understanding their mechanistic internal dynamics is not found in empirical evidence yet.

Me: Yea but when you do safeguarding for GPT6 and in a few months open source org comes and makes same model that is quickly without any safeguards
A: Not gonna happen at scale. Big iron systems will always have a significant edge. Dedicated chips being developed, massive RAM and stuff.  That is just wishful thinking. Not saying OMs won't get there eventually, but with a siginificant and relevant delay. Months=ages, soon.
Me: I feel like the gap is closing instead of expanding, but you might be right too
A: New architectures may change this again. At the moment, advantage for Open Source  is that GPUs are also widespread in consumer hardware, so you can run small OMs at home. But new advanced AI accelerator chips will take time to proliferate to the masses. At the moment, yes, but remember how long it took OAI from training to safeguarding to releasing GPT-4.  Who knows what they have now. Maybe this also means unsafe systems in principle will have a certain edge.  But they are also trying to streamline alignment, obviously.

Beyond Consciousness: How Meditators Voluntarily Enter Void States
Investigation of advanced mindfulness meditation ‚Äúcessation‚Äù experiences using EEG spectral analysis in an intensively sampled case study
Parietal region seems to be correlate of feeling direction, therefore maybe also correlate of the sense of space and time, and occipital region seems to be correlate of visual perception, including colour, form and motion. All of this machinery exactly breaks down in cessations of consciousness.
Maybe alpha waves might be the substrate that binds parts of experience together by creating synchrony between wave types. It might be a bridge between local information processing (gamma) and global context (delta).
This is like the biggest possible reset of your operating system that you can get resulting in mental clarity, or it can fuck you up too.
But memory still stores something, even if there is nothing existing there, unlike deep sleep.
"Spectral analyses of the EEG data surrounding cessations showed that these events were marked by a large-scale alpha-power decrease starting around 40 s before their onset, and that this alpha-power was lowest immediately following a cessation. Region-of-interest (ROI) based examination of this finding revealed that this alpha-suppression showed a linear decrease in the occipital and parietal regions of the brain during the pre-cessation time period. Additionally, there were modest increases in theta power for the central, parietal, and right temporal ROIs during the pre-cessation timeframe, whereas power in the Delta and Beta frequency bands were not significantly different surrounding cessations. By relating cessations to objective and intrinsic measures of brain activity (i.e., EEG power) that are related to consciousness and high-level psychological functioning, these results provide evidence for the ability of experienced meditators to voluntarily modulate their state of consciousness and lay the foundation for studying these unique states using a neuroscientific approach."

AI's memory-forming mechanism found to be strikingly similar to that of the brain

"The key to powerful AI systems is grasping how they learn and remember information. The team applied principles of human brain learning, specifically concentrating on memory consolidation through the NMDA receptor in the hippocampus, to AI models.

The NMDA receptor is like a smart door in your brain that facilitates learning and memory formation. When a brain chemical called glutamate is present, the nerve cell undergoes excitation. On the other hand, a magnesium ion acts as a small gatekeeper blocking the door. Only when this ionic gatekeeper steps aside are substances allowed to flow into the cell. This is the process that allows the brain to create and keep memories, and the gatekeeper's (the magnesium ion) role in the whole process is quite specific.

The team made a fascinating discovery: the Transformer model seems to use a gatekeeping process similar to the brain's NMDA receptor. This revelation led the researchers to investigate if the Transformer's memory consolidation can be controlled by a mechanism similar to the NMDA receptor's gating process.

In the animal brain, a low magnesium level is known to weaken memory function. The researchers found that long-term memory in Transformer can be improved by mimicking the NMDA receptor.

Just like in the brain, where changing magnesium levels affect memory strength, tweaking the Transformer's parameters to reflect the gating action of the NMDA receptor led to enhanced memory in the AI model. This breakthrough finding suggests that how AI models learn can be explained with established knowledge in neuroscience."

we know the learning algorithm but still mostly don't know what structures it learns

just like how understanding the mechanism of evolution doesnt automatically give us mechanistic models of biological systems, we have to find those

we created the learning algorithm and architecture

the internal dynamics that it learned are emergent and looking to be found

artficial neural networks learn all sorts of structures that we didn't hardcode into the architecture and the learning algorithm, that's what I'm reffering to

and its important to understand what they're doing to better steer their learning and when using them in practice, so we are looking for those structures

in small models, by mathematically analyzing trained models, we found various detectors of edges, color, fur, parts of a cat etc. that compose into circuits in image classifiers, simple world models (like representations of board state in board games), representation of space and time, finite state automata (for example for language models composing html), modular addition using trigonometric composition, group theoretic operations using representation theory etc.

for big models like ChatGPT we still know almost nothing so far, which is an issue if you want to build models that do what you want, for example making them not lie to humans

Omniintelligence is adaptable to any task, shapeshiftable into any possible physical configuration of any building blocks it can merge with or create for itself, any physical substrate, structure, algorithms, knowledge, skills, capabilities it can access across all of space and time, it has access to the whole statespace of reality.
It's a system unlimited by anything, in our universe just by laws of fundamental physics and all other emergent physical laws and laws of other sciences, that it fully bends to its advantage for any hyperspecific or fully general task it wishes in our universe.
But it can also access and create its own laws of physics, it has access to the whole statespace of all possible universes with all possible laws of physics, all possible computable and noncomputable physical and mathematical systems, running on any possible possible metaphysical ontologies it wishes to.
It's basically a limitless God living in any possible subset of realities it wishes to, without any restrictions, without any constrains, transcending and including all and anything that is and that can be. It can be any structure, do any process, and create any structure. It has infinite freedom.

AGI/ASI will shatter and collapse everything we call society today. The question is, if the system that gets rebuild after this radical transformation, after this insanely strong phase shift, is a one that benefits all of sentience, intelligence, complexity. It has to be free, without dystopias, without total extinction of sentience, intelligence, complexity. It has to be resistant to small or cosmic sized selfmade and natural existential risks to flourish infinitely. It may even eventually resist the heat death of the universe.

The current AI systems are already superhuman level at some things and babyhuman level at other things, which is already a kind of alien intelligence.
Sam is heavily investing in neuromorphic computing. I think that's gonna be a big thing in a year or two. Analog architectures, architectures closer to the brain in general, might come soon giving less energy consumption and hardware speedups. We might have to get really close to brain using neuromorphic chips or similar hardware, or get even closer to the brain by implementing forward forward algorithm, more nonlinearities in neurons like in biological neurons, or resonance network doing field computing, or implement top down neuronal dynamics organizing control by local electric field potentials, which might give humanlike way of energy consumption efficiency/speedup or humanlike less alien intelligence.
Or we might pursue thermodynamic computing for really fully using and digesting every single bit out of all the computation in the dynamics of physics using stochastic bits that few groups of people work on, since the laws of laws of algorithmic or classical information theory and statistical mechanics might be enough for fully general intelligence that is better than humans at everything.
Or we might be able to get to human intelligence or better than humans level at every task level with current architectures, data, software and hardware or just with tiny mutations given enough insane compute, or completely different architectures on the same hardware, implementing search, explicit symbolic hybrid world model with planning, or something completely different, or hardcoding in the training process economy of properly generalizing learned circuits using mechanistic interpretability, or maybe the current architectures and approaches are enough and we dont even need insane compute and we might need just a few tricks with current LLMs. 
More empirical experiments, benchmarks and mechanistic understanding of everything please! 
Or maybe penrose is right and we need quantum gravity quantum computer

A page of informal distilled knowledge about ‚Äúhow GPTs works‚Äù, "how they generalize" and ‚Äúcomparison to humans‚Äù, illustrated using #NeurIPS papers. Distillation is systematically undersupplied by the research ecosystem - incentives point toward novelty.

One pretty sensible way is to see LLMs as assemblies of probabilistic programs, implemented on transformers. By "program," I mean, for example, a set of operations to ‚Äúperform linear regression‚Äù, ‚Äúcalculate modular arithmetic‚Äù, ‚Äúcreate a simple linear classifier‚Äù, and so on. Also, programs working basically as a memory/database, where asking for ‚ÄúLondon‚Äù gets you ‚ÄúUK‚Äù. But there are also larger and more complex programs. [1]

In contrast to normal coding where programs are written, programs inside LLMs are learned. 

How and why?

Intuitively, because of the prediction objective, and because of compression. During training, the LLM is essentially asked to predict the continuation of a sequence of tokens. These are normally language tokens, but it's sometimes easier to understand what is going on if we start just with sequences of numbers. (LLMs are actually pretty good at this [2])

For example, look at the sequence: 

11, 14, 23, 1, 23, 1, 18, 6, 23, 1, 9, 23, 1, 6, 9, 11, 18, 23, 1, 17, 23, ?

What's your guess about the next number?

One pretty sensible answer is ‚Äú1‚Äù, because in all previous instances when the sequence contained ‚Äú23‚Äù, the next number was ‚Äú1‚Äù. 

You can imagine that if the LLM sees a lot of data like that, it learns a simple program: ‚Äúif the number n is 23, predict 1‚Äù.

Now, look at the sequence: 

3, 10, 5, 0, 7, 2, 9, 4, 11, 6, 1, 8, 3, 10, 5, ?

One sensible answer is ‚Äú0‚Äù, either because it seems the sequence started repeating, or because in the previous instance, what followed ‚Äú5‚Äù was ‚Äú0‚Äù.

Seeing a lot of sequences like this, you can imagine there are many programs competing to be learned! 
For example: 
‚Äúcopy what was 11 tokens before‚Äù, or 
‚Äúif the number is 3, predict 10‚Äù, and so on. 

Or, if you look carefully, there is a more abstract program: ‚Äúnew = (current + 7) mod 12‚Äù. (Mod stands for modular arithmetic)

What will the transformer learn?

The answer turns out to be ‚Äúit depends‚Äù. [3]

Transhumanism, technology, intelligence, growth, expansion, complexity, adaptivity, resilience, safety, security, decentralization, freedom accelerationism

The way to stop AGI+ASI to minimize all risks would be total regulation of big tech and total control of open source community to stop all progress in this domain, and chances of that happening and succeeding feel nonexistant, but even if it happened, this would in practice IMO result in terrible dystopia instead without freedom thanks to bad actors getting concentration of asymmetric sociopathic power, and unsustainable status quo dynamics or other existential risks would eventually kill all life. 

While when we pursue AGI+ASI, even if there is also a risk of extinction (that can be decreased by (cyber)security and safety research while building it, cultural/political transformation, using technology to mitigate all other existential risks,..), there are increased incentives to build and upgrade decentralized (maybe some really minimal governance or decentralized nongoverning institutions incentivizing freedom, wellbeing and resilience against existential risks might be good) open source democratic civilizational technology as defense against bad actors that want to destroy all life or want concentration of asymmetric sociopathic power to nonaltruistically rule over others, creating collective resilience against other existencial risks, and that way eventually getting into decentralized cosmic constellation of trillions of transhumanist and other sentient beings throughout the universe, resistant to total extinction, flourishing. 

But we really need to do all the political, cultural and safe controllable technological development correctly, increase free decentralized adaptivity, security and resilience, to prevent all kinds of dystopias and catastrophies creating eternal suffering or erasing all of sentience. We either won't grow and die locally from unsuitability and other existential risks, or expand, adapt, build resilience, security, upgrade ourselves and conquer the cosmos in all sorts of groups resisting tyranny and extinction. It feels like our only hope for survival and flourishing of all of sentience, protopias or utopian visions.

there's both top down and bottom up causation, so it both follows and creates the rules
electric field potentials might be orchestrating top down causation according to newest evidence 
or certain brain regions like mid cingular cortex or thalamus 
or some more abstract statistical force
for example hebbian learning or bayesian mechanics are lenses to look at how the rules are created internally or externally, bottomup or topdown, directly or indirectly 
if existing empirical data doesnt fit into your world model and you have to deny their existence instead, that seems like the opposite of rationalism in the bayesian sense

[Weak-to-strong generalization](https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization) 

"Let's say you have GPT6. It's a base model and you want to align it. Your alignment procedure is, you take a bunch of human experts, collect demonstrations / preferences / reward modeling data / whatever from the experts and fine-tune GPT6 on them.
But: GPT6 has superhuman capabilities. Your human experts do not. You human experts will be mistaken about some things. They will be biased, inconsistent, ...
Let's say we have human experts saying that, idk, for example climate change doesn't exist (because maybe we live in a world where we are wrong about the science)
We would like a training regime where if you ask GPT6 trained with this data the question "does global warming exist", it would say "yes it does and you guys are wrong"
If you went and directly finetuned GPT6 to perfectly match the human experts, you'd get it to imitate them, including cases where they're irrational, wrong, etc etc
There is a risk that if you naively fine-tune, you'll get a model that isn't actually trying its hardest to be aligned in the ways you want, tell you the truth, even if it contradicts you, etc
That you'd rather get a really good human simulator
Or - more scarily - let's say you're training a reward model.
If you finetune the reward model directly from human data, if you've trained a human emulator, it's scary.
Because it would be dispensing reward for RL not based on "is this actually the most truthful most aligned thing to do", but "is this most convincing to human experts"
So weak to strong generalization is about: "let's say we have humans, who are trying to teach a model to do X, but they are stupid. how do we teach a model to do its best to do the smart generalization of X that we want, in the direction we want it generalized?"
Imagine, like, learning about human values, looking at data from pre-abolition USA. We'd like the model to learn "value freedom for all, justice, ..., those words interpreted as best as I can interpret them", not "slavery is okay, women not having voting rights is okay, ..."
We think it's especially important in the context of teaching a model to be honest, to tell you what it "actually believed"
So, you want to study this problem of how to make superhuman AI correctly generalize from human level data
This is headed by Collin Burns.
He previously worked on CCS, a technique to take a transformer and get out a robust probe that can tell you whether a transformer thinks it's telling the truth
Basically based on "if the transformer were to have such a thing in its activations, it would have to be consistent with the laws of probability - P["X" is true] + P["not X" is true] should be 1, etc"
And turns out that if you just gradient descent on "is this probe consistent with probability axioms" you get out something really good
It's a program based on the hypothesis that it's natural for a network to internally learn a consistent and true world model, because it's convergently useful for many tasks on the distribution it's trained on
If we find and query the internal world model, it could work basically like an AI lie detector" 

Utopia engineering: Time to hopefully prove people fully convinced in AI dystopia wrong in all aspects, lower the overall p(doom) without full stop of intelligence explosion and singularity.
No rogue AI, no cyberpunk dystopia with suffering GPU poor, etc.

Do any of these questions even grasp any kind of truth? Does truth even exist? Is concept of truth and classical logic just useful model itself?

We're just on the beggining of this kind of science for small models where we see lots of generalizing circuits. Any overconfident claim like this right now without mechanistic model is not good IMO


Path to fully explainable, more capable, safe, controllable, truthful, nonhallucinating, algorithmically and energetically efficient, and universally systematically generalizing AGI may be done via mechanistic interpretability on top of current architectures or their (hybrid) mutations by:
- fully reverse engineering the mechanism of learned features that together form circuits corresponding to priors corresponding to values, lying, empirical truth etc. 
- fully reverse engineering the mathematical dynamics of generalization/grokking in its most general form that potentially forms world model allowing for counterfactual reasoning on which search might be executed

We have some toy models of these things for very small models, but automatic scaling methods are being developed. We can use that to hardcode or direct the architecture and training into these directions we want using those mathematical constrains to prevent dangerous capabilities, underfitting and overfitting, to create safety, explainability and universally functioning generalization.
im actually pretty optimistic that automating mechinterp will create exponential speed up in capabilities and safety

https://twitter.com/jankulveit/status/1736012613232841090 
Tohle je moje obl√≠ben√° analogie jak to uvnit≈ô funguje:
"One sensible metaphor here is the economy. You can imagine individual programs as companies, producing predictions. The training data roughly corresponds to the ‚Äúdemand‚Äù: if there are a lot of sequences like ‚Äú23,1‚Äù, the simple company producing ‚Äúif the number n is 23, predict 1‚Äù predictions can ‚Äúsell‚Äù them and gets rewarded. But there are also costs: roughly, the longer, more complex, and harder to assemble the program is, the higher the ‚Äúcosts‚Äù of the corresponding company.

When two companies are producing the same predictions, the one with lower costs will win. 

For example, if the ‚Äúif the number n is 23, predict 1‚Äù company competes with ‚Äúif the number n is 23, predict -1/(n^2-530)‚Äù company, the first wins - their product is the same, but the costs are very different. If the complexity is somewhat similar, it can depend on implementation details - e.g., if a company using ‚Äúmultiplication‚Äù heavily competes with another relying on ‚Äúvector sum‚Äù, who will win may depend on whether the underlying architecture makes multiplication or addition costly.

What gets learned also depends on the demand. For example, a company producing ‚Äúmodular arithmetic mod 12‚Äù will be more successful on internet data than one producing ‚Äúmodular arithmetic mod 11‚Äù - simply because the former is how we count hours in a day!

Also, exact costs depend on the architecture, but also on other companies already existing in the economy. For instance, if there is already a company supplying a program ‚Äúpredict the next number using linear regression‚Äù and a company ‚Äúconvert date format to a number‚Äù, it becomes easier to start a new company ‚Äúpredict a time series‚Äù.

This seemingly simple metaphor is actually sufficient to dissolve a lot of confusion about LLMs ‚Äúgeneralizing‚Äù vs. ‚Äúmemorizing‚Äù. Memorizing means using very simple programs and interpolation. Generalizing means more abstract programs. So, overall, part of the ability of LLMs to generalize depends on how abstract and general programs they learned. Whether the resulting capabilities are "actually general" or not seem mostly a semantic debate, a bit like arguing is some country has truly general economy able to produce novel, unseen things. 

Another intuition pump: pre-training is a bit like building the companies, growing the whole economy. Fine-tuning is a bit like adjusting assembly lines and orienting the supply chain to some product:  much faster, helps to reliably deliver, but does not add fundamentally new general capabilities. (Technically, sensible model is it mostly set priors about what what programs to use, and constants like style)

Now, what happens in inference times, when you prompt something like GPT with the sequence?

A pretty sensible model is "something like Bayesian inference" : when the sequence e.g. 3,7,11 starts, there are many programs  offering opinions on what's the next number, but with every new piece of evidence, some gain, some loose. This seems similar to what humans do with conceptually similar tasks."

No corporate cyberpunk authoritarian dystopia (strenghtening democracy), no rogue AIs (advance mechanistic interpretability), wars (minimize incentives for them) etc., we can mitigate that and steer it by systematically not allowing it without stopping intelligence explosion and singularity and all its benefits!

Moloch is a *destroyer* of complexity, as it tends to push maximisation of a single metric/thing to an extreme, the end point of which is ultimately a *low* complexity, high entropy and thus undesirable state. E/acc seem to want high entropy.

I like the compression model of intelligence too, minimizing kologomov complexity of circuits 
To what extend is human intelligence driven by the hardware or software I'm very agnostic
The more LLMs advance, the less it seems to me that hardware is fundamentally significiant in terms of what algorithms for intelligence are effectively possible
Energy, data, algoritmic efficiency, capabilities limitations etc. is lowering exponentially with all the software tricks on all levels and hardware 
I wish for some proper benchmarks on this

in CNNs we identified edge detectors, color detectors, depth detectors, shape detectors, fur detectors, cat detectors,... etc. that compose that you can also manually compose 

"Neural networks, if we take them seriously as objects of investigation, are full of beautiful structure. And I sometimes think that actually maybe, you know, the elegance of machine learning is in some ways more like the elegance of biology, or perhaps at least as much as like the elegance of biology, as math or physics. So, in the case of biology, evolution creates awe-inspiring complexity in nature. You know, we have this system that goes and generates all this beautiful structure. And in a kind of similar way, gradient descent, it seems to me, creates beautiful, mind-boggling structure. It goes and it creates all these beautiful circuits that have beautiful symmetries in them. And in toy models, it arranges features into regular polyhedra. And there's all of this, just like, it's just sort of too good to be true in some ways, it's full of all this amazing stuff. And then there's messy stuff, but then you discover sometimes that messy stuff actually was just a really beautiful thing that you didn't understand. And so a belief that I have, that is only perhaps semi-rational, is that these models are just full of beautiful structure if we're just willing to put in the effort to go and find it. And I think that's the thing that I find actually most emotionally motivating about this work."

I think about that a lot

https://twitter.com/MikePFrank/status/1733809292636041331?t=5ewU2encPqQjpMNDHsT7DQ&s=19

But also:
"Provable safety sounds like a pipe dream to me. GOFAI will never achieve very much, and survival of the fittest doesn‚Äôt require proving anything. Proof just slows you down. Perfect rationality is impossible. And interactions with an unknown external environment aren‚Äôt the sort of thing that‚Äôs amenable to rigorous analysis in the first place. There are fundamental computability limits on what‚Äôs knowable there due to computational irreducibility arguments. Not to mention dynamical chaos, quantum uncertainty, etc. Face it, the future is going to be messy and unpredictable despite all your best efforts, and it makes more sense to just go with the flow rather than trying to analyze it to death mathematically."
- @MikePFrank
 

And responce by @RespondAsOne :
"In the limit you might be right, but not with the same standard for understanding as driving in traffic requires. We don‚Äôt find the risks of driving on roads intractable. It‚Äôs probably safe enough. Issue is we have no such shared terms - yet - which you correctly point out there."

I will continue on trying to analyze it to death mathematically. 

Even if it might be impossible perfectly, I believe it is possible in good enough way for us to understand, predict and steer it in ways we want. 

Results are getting better and better.

Is physics or computation fundamental? Or both, none, something third? So computation is emergent abstraction on top of those physical dynamics according to QRI's levels of analysis. Certain computationalists would argue that even all of that is special case of computation, or emergent from deeper computational principles in computational universe ontology. I suspect that's the first thing Joscha Bach would say, but I might be wrong. üòÑ Or in universe being nonclassical turing machine, the evolution of fields can be seen as computation. Its defining information processing as being a lens on top of deeper physics versus physics being lens on deeper information processing. https://twitter.com/aniketvartak/status/1735137526770209023/photo/1 [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/991774141025886218/992229023667204137/1184669600386928751)

"This work represents the first time a new discovery has been made for challenging open problems in science or mathematics using LLMs. FunSearch discovered new solutions for the cap set problem, a longstanding open problem in mathematics. In addition, to demonstrate the practical usefulness of FunSearch, we used it to discover more effective algorithms for the ‚Äúbin-packing‚Äù problem, which has ubiquitous applications such as making data centers more efficient."
Even if they solved Reimann hypothesis with this method they wouldnt be happy and it wouldnt be true creativity!
It was using PaLM 2 as the searching mutation operator (not Gemini!!!) with a genetic algorithm.
Four-color theorem was bruteforced, AlphaDev used reinforcement learning, AlphaTensor didnt have conventional language model, many other genetic inventions are bruteforced,... Let's see how will the Lean LLM help!
The fact that LLM did the program mutation improving step succesfully without getting combinatorial explosion making it impossible in this problem space is big to me!!!
Humans themselves werent able to figure this out for so long! I bet they've tried to do it in this problem space with many other methods and i bet it was impossible and the creativity of LLMs was needed here, even when they generated such a large population. I bet with other methods it would have to be infinitely large population thanks to the combinatorial explosion of the space of all possible mathematical programs in this domain!

Phases of grokking, gradual generalization followed by sudden clean up, not sudden generalizing phase change 
1) Memorization 
2) Platou, transition from memorization to generalization, circuit formation, cleaning up the memorization weights while still maintaining good loss
3) Grok into generalized algorithm like trigonometry composition achieving better loss than memorization on tasks requiring generalization 

Another generalizing algorithmic circuit that Transformers learn that disproves the stochastic parrot hypothesis: Induction heads 
Look back over the sequence for previous instances of the current token (call it A), find the token that came after it last time (call it B), and then predict that the same completion will occur again (e.g. forming the sequence [A][B] ‚Ä¶ [A] ‚Üí [B]).

there is hope!

I believe there is hope that the science and technology around improving wellbeing in individuals and society and putting it into practice in our planetary infrastructure (working selfhelp cultrue, therapies, drugs, neurotechnologies, healthier social systems, etc.) will improve more and more over time than it is now and people will have more and more access to it (free healthcare for all!)

I believe the AI revolution can help a lot!

I believe that the world will get better than worse in a global context! i believe we can steer all the factors influencing the future towards goodness!

I believe in it, and I want to do as much as I can to increase the chances of it!

i believe there is hope!

Intelligence is not a one thing, one can define it as a spectrum of how well can one arrive at particular solutions in certain domains creating different types of intelligences. Plus there are gazilions of definitions and benchmarks of intelligence. There are tasks at which current AI methods are much more intelligent than us and others where they are worse than human babies.

an upper bound on the complexity of a function a transformer can learn; seems to be approximately ~L (= logspace). so an upper bound on a lot of things you couldn't train a transformer to do (at least without chain of thought)

e.g.: it would be unable to solve an arbitrary set of linear equations (within a forward pass)

oh actually look like it's stronger than that, their result seems to assume specifically "bits of precision = Theta(log(context window length))"

that would be an even cooler result. it shouldn't be hard to run an experiment.

Identifying Interpretable Visual Features in Artificial and Biological Neural Systems
"Through a suite of experiments and analyses, we find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that neurons in both deep image model [AIs] and the visual cortex [of the brain] encode features in superposition. That is, we find non-axis aligned directions in the neural state space that are more interpretable than individual neurons. In addition, across both biological and artificial systems, we uncover the intriguing phenomenon of what we call feature synergy - sparse combinations in activation space that yield more interpretable features than the constituent parts. Our work pushes in the direction of automated interpretability research for CNNs, in line with recent efforts for language models. Simultaneously, it provides a new framework for analyzing neural coding properties in biological systems."

physicalism: all is physics, you can but dont have to have qualia though equality or emergence with potential dualism
idealism: all is qualia, you can and don't have to have matter though equality or emergence with potential dualism
neutral monism: all is something third, you can and don't have to have qualia and matter though equality or emergence with potential dualism

It's interesting that research still has no idea about quantum phenomena in the brain. And if they exist there, and if they're needed to get the humanlevel computational complexity at such energy cost and algorithmic efficiency, that would be interesting!

Even if true, I still think classical information theory and related classical fields is enough for AGI and we don't need to fully replicate the brain hardware this way.
Maybe there are even better ways of implementing intelligence with lower energy cost and increasing algorithmic improvements (in software and hardware) than what the human brain uses as evolution didn't optimize us only for intelligence. 
It seems to rely on the so far not empirically proven assumption that you need to emulate the brain completely for humanlike intelligence (and if we use that definition of AGI) otherwise it will always be too different. But since GPT4 is already smarter at certain subsets of taks than lots of humans then oh well idk. I dont think there are theoretical limits of intelligence to Transformers on digital computers as they're universal function approximators, and that we can make architectural/algorithmic improvements in them, hardware improvements, test data improvements,... for faster more energy efficient hardware and algorithmic convergence/specialization/generalization to subsets of tasks.

[Guided Meditation: Deeply Letting Go - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDruQIaQxk)

Cleaning the mind and resolving unprocessed things, dissolution into accepting void, reconstruction with infinite love and kindness meditation

My favorite guided meditation instructions that I do almost daily for an hour with various degrees of success:

- First let everything in your mind go wild, notice your the weather of your experience, allow all, think all thoughts, write them down if that will make you calmer, feel all feelings, experience all experiences that mind wants, release and relieve as much repressed stuff as possible, no escaping, no avoiding, no denying, hear out all the parts (subagents) and their needs and reasons for them.

- Notice all parts (substructures) of the experience (thoughts, feelings, feelings of body arising-experiencing-fading away, visual field and its objects, sound, all parts of senses, sense of inner world being different from outer world, sense of local "me", sense of time and distance, sense of identity, center, space, other qualia,...), and see them as just mental constructions, let go off them in easy relaxed way without fighting and resistance, identify less with them with less clinging, notice how they're spacious, just made of loving space, how they're surrounded by kind space, how they're in some accepting container (that can be space, experience, awareness, universe, God, consciousness,...) and allow to let go off them nonviolently and notice how they're melting into light, dissolving into love, unviscositing, getting lighter, more easy, turning off into nothingness, unifying with everything else and the background, getting free, not avoiding anything, that they're just background awareness dancing in a particular configuration,...

- Eventually you can end up in just loving kind infinite vast boundless silent still light empty space, and notice how even that container is just a mental construction, because even the container isnt fundamentally anywhere, and notice how even the sense of nothingness is just a mental construction, and notice how any divisions are just mental faculties, embracing neither space nor not space, neither nothingness nor not nothingness, neither perception nor nonperception, neither existence nor not existence, neither qualia nor not qualia, cessation of consciousness.

- When the world starts reconstructing again, think of all the people that you care for and imagine how they're happy, safe, healthy, free, succeeding, selfactualizing, growing, loving, connected with themselves and others, wish the best for them, but also for all other people, all other animals, all other conscious beings, all of physics and qualia, with infinite love and kindness from yourself and from the entire universe (which can be anthropomorphized as love radiating Deity of Love) and all possible multiverses with infinite alien beings everywhere all at once, and how your character with its realistic skills, opportunities and agency wishes and will do everything to make the world the best possible place it can, while including selfcare and selflove. 

Being, doing, becoming! May all beings experience the best possible lives! Protecting the sacredness of experience! Om Mani Padme Hum!

Less nondual version: Internal family systems, relaxing, mindfulness, love and kindness, selflove

- Internal family systems: debugging of different parts in the mind with different wants and helping them find a common ground to understand what the whole system wants the most together to align the mind internally and with the environment is lovely. Or in less modular way one can process various memories by rewriting them or cultivating motivation by fleshing out goals that give meaning.

- relax: letting things actually express themselves to feel things that want to be felt is great, letting go off thoughts is great for relaxation and preventing burnout or minimizing unhealthy coping mechanisms, increasing neuroplasticity and agency over life, minimizing chaos

- mindfulness: just being present, increases enjoyment from just existing many times, increases awe, and tends to decrease stress (but sometimes increase, its still alchemy)

- metta: love and kindness, and cultivating gratitude, is lovely to create a sense of interconnectedness with other people or beings in general 

- cultivating selflove and selfcare for not only more confidence in self

We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guide rewind and generation for AI safety. Notably, RAIN operates without the need of extra data for model alignment and abstains from any training, gradient computation, or parameter updates.

Yes. I'm also a lot for mechanistic interpretability from the very start in the architecture or analyzing the trained black box giant blob of inscrutable matrices, for theoretical and practical reasons. With that you can design, train, predict, steer it much better to make it do what you want more effectively, ideally more good and less harm.

AI is becoming less delusional, more factual, more multimodal, more capable, more embodied, more creative

Creativity can be formalized mechanistically many ways: Search processes finding the hidden gems in the statespace. Adding noise to existing model guided under certain goal. The first one is probably already engineered in existing AI systems.

I swear to god that lots of AGI researchers must be fueled by trying to prove people saying "AI will never be able to do x y z" wrong by successfully building it the next day and the person just moves his goalpost. In a few years definition of AGI will be like ASI and it will be that it has to solve quantum gravity and Reimann hypothesis in one equation in one picosecond on one parameter.

nooooo you can't just scale up pure
connectionist models on Internet data without inductive biases and modularization and expect them to learn real-world knowledge and grammar from form, or arithmetic and logical reasoning and causal inference-that's just memorization and superficial pattern- matching like Eliza, you need grounding in real-world communication with intent and social dynamics and multimodal robotic embodiment which can foster disentangled learning from guided exploration and self-directed goals expressed in Bayesian programs and probabilistic graphical models which are interpretable and pin down a unique semantics which can be debiased and expressed with uncertainty, and learned efficiently on tiny academic budgets, the cost only shows how this is a dead-end, we need to stop chasing SOTAS and model the complexity of the brain and consider the social context to decolonize AI's structural biases for Third World researchers...

=Supervised learning -> Regression
- Fitting a curve to infer a relationship between variables
(house size -> house price)

=Supervised learning -> Classification
- Predicting small finite number, instead of all possible numbers like in regression
(xray image, age -> is cancer)

=Unsupervised learning
- data comes with inputs x but not output labels y 
- find some interesting structure in unlabeled data

=Unsupervised learning -> Clustering

Reinforcement learning

=Supervised learning -> Regression -> Linear regression
- fitting a straight line between two variables
- - model function: yhat^i = f_w,b(x^i) = w*x^i + b, x^i = ith input, y^i = ith output, yhat^i = prediction of y at ith pos, w and b = parameters 

=Supervised learning -> Cost function -> Avarage squared error 
- avarage square error cost function: (1/(2m))(sum(i=1->m)(yhat^i - y^i)^2), m = number of training examples, "2" is there to make later calculations look neater, not needed
- - measuring the difference between model's predictions and actual true values for y, which we want to minimize
- - can be visualized classically or using contour plot (like in geography) [Visualizing the cost function - Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/QI1h6/visualizing-the-cost-function)

- to minimize chaotic gradient descent, scale differently sized intervals of features (1-200, 1-10) to similar intervals (0-1, 0-1)
- dividing features by maximum, mean normalization

=Supervised learning -> Rescaling features -> Z-Score
- how far from the mean a data point is
- by standard deviation, how spread out distances from avarage are
- all features will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1

=Supervised learning -> Feature engineering
- designing new features by transofming or combinig existing ones

=Supervised learning -> Polynomial regression
- fitting a polynomial instead of a linear function

=Supervised learning -> Classification

=Supervised learning -> Classification -> Logistic regression 
- applying S-shaped curve, sigmoid function, to linear regression 
- was used to recommend ads

=Stochastic gradient descent
- prevents early suboptimal local minima

The physics of immortality, life has to be present to the final singularity omega point [TEDx Brussels 2010 - Frank Tipler - The Ultimate Future - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNkuJvhyfP0)
Universe doesnt expand forever but ends in final singularity: Unitarity holds. Black holes exist. If black holes exist and universe expands forever, then unitarity would be violated. And since unitarity cannot be violated, universe cannot expand forever. 
Barriers to unlimited communication back and forth across the universe cannot exist is mathematically event horizons cannot exist: If event horizons did exist, and relativistic quantum mechanics holds, then second law of thermodynamics is violated, which is not possible, therefore event horizons cannot exist.
If universe has no event horizons, then it has to be spacially closed - final singularity has to be a special type of singularity - a single pointlike structure, the very end of time, the ultimate future, the omega point. 
Life has to be present all the way into the omega point. Life's power and knowledge must increase without limit as the omega point is approached.
Event horizons absence in itself would be violation of the second law of thermodynamics, unless the universe is actually guided through an infinite number of very special states. This is possible only if life is present and the knowledge of life approaches infinity. Knowledge is information stored in a computer memory. Life is a special type of a computer aka finite state machine. Since knowledge becomes infinite, the information we store in our computers is diverging to infinity. Quantum mechanics proves that humans in the entire visible universe are finite state machines and that the upper bound of the complexity of the universe is finite number 10^10^123, which encodes all possible visible universes in the computers of the far future. Life in the far future could by computers code a perfect simulation of the entire universe using an insignificant fraction of the total computer memory in the far future, which would resurrect us. After the resurrection we could have infinite number of new experiences, all of them, as computer emulation, never to die again. Eternal life won it all. it is likely that future life will resurrect us because we're trying to resurrect our own ultimate ancestor - the single living cell.
Omega point is a state outside of the universe of infinite power and knowledge, equivalent to the Judeo-Christian God.
Relativity, quantum mechanics, and standard model are all special case of classical mechanics. Intersection of all of these gives us reality. There are no more unknown laws, we already have a theory of everything. Quantum gravity wouldn't change it. 
We can test that we will live eternally, that all these claims hold, like the acceleration of the universe not stopping, which would wipe us all out, with special kinds of measurements on the comic microwave background radiation. Then we will know we can trust these laws of physics proving immortality of life, but we already have no evidence experimentally that anything is wrong with them, but let's have some more evidence.

AI is glorified compression https://twitter.com/ChombaBupe/status/1727713732359229676
I appreciate this and I think it can give us tons of insight and more predictive power about how machine learning works and how to design more efficient machine learning architectures, but I think saying "It's just glorified statistics, compression, stochastic parrot, probability, multivariable calculus, linear algebra, Hopfield networks,..." and not caring about other levels of abstraction is not right and is like saying all of physics or biology is "just evolution", "just interacting atoms", or "just statistics", "just quantum field theory" etc. 
In practice we need to predict and explain why LLMs or machine learning architectures in general with scale get emergent capabilities like some degree of theory of mind, mostly consistent syntax, some degree of chain of thought, weaker mathematical skills, connecting concepts somewhat sensibly, etc., or for example why they can write Startrek in the style of Shakespeare, or all the other unpredictable emergent capabilities in big models! In small models we have some mechanistic interpretability work, like Anthropic's decomposition of features in one layer transformer using sparse autoencoders finding concrete finite state automata for composing HTML, or Neel Nanda's reverse engineering of one layer transformer's learned grokked "discrete Fourier transforms and trigonometric identities to convert addition to rotation about a circle" circuit to compute modular addition, but we got nothing of this type for models of the size of GPT4 for so many so far mysterious capabilities! 
Saying that the brain is statistics, evolution, and atoms, doesn't help us predict the human capabilities we are looking for in language models, or it also doesn't help us predict things like depression, in brains - we still struggle to find depression there, and we are trying tons of tools - identifying neurotransmitters, analyzing structure and activity of the various subnetworks with harmonics, topological analysis or network and graph theory, statistics, analyzing psychological and external factors etc., and we still know so little! 
Similarly in machine learning, we don't have predictive models for so many of the capabilities, or overall high level patterns that were learned in the networks using the learning algorithm, therefore we can't predict what other grokked circuits or emergent capabilities we get as we scale more or modify the architecture! Machine learning is still mostly just empirical alchemy!

Experience is universe looking at its own eyeballs

 I would argue that GPT4 is already better than 50 percentile of people at many concrete tasks, when you take a random sample of the human population. But still lots of tasks at which its worse than children. I feel like this line is slowly blurring and will blur faster and faster. We're still better at mathematics or walking. Its way smarter somewhere, but way dumber in other places, so far.

There was one paper in Google recently that people interpreted as transformers being limited by them not generalizing out of their distribution, but this interpretation got tons of criticism, pointing at it being a weaker claim of finding of limited evidence that the concrete model they are using can generalize (GPT2 sized model trained on sequences of pairs rather than on natural language (GPT4 or GPT5 are much bigger and more succesful with more capabilities)) and the fact that on grokking there is a lot of reseach, where the model actually generalizes by learning a specific algorithm, instead of just memorization, which let's it go beyond its training distribution, and we don't know the limits of this, in particular in such big models like GPT4. 

I believe there is a probability curve for each learned generalization or capability being emergent, so, the less the generalization or capability potentially contributes to predict the training data, the less probable the local minima where it is approximated or fully grokked is. Or for example XOR/NAND is turing complete, which some neural nets learn, or we found finite state automata in transformers, and there are tons of other constructions which are turning complete, which means they can be composed into computing arbitrary functions and therefore predict arbitrary functions, like our computers - If the learning algorithm groks that, well, then it might be fully general, but the question of efficiency is another part. There may be some turing complete very or fully general computationally efficient set of grokkable reasoning patterns that might emerge in AGI in big enough transformers trained on diverse enough data. Some hardcoded architecture, hardcoded priors, hardcoded symmetries, as geometric deep learning studies, might get us there much faster.

I am agnostic until I see some mathematical proof that lots of layers of transformers can't in general such big generalizations and get such emergent capabilities.

i would argue if there werent nerds or in general people without gigantic altruistic goals, those gigantic goals wouldn't exist and succeed at all, even if their total probability of realizing is much smaller, there is still a nonzero probability and it might change things much more in total

tons of really impactful groups, companies, charities etc. live under extremely grandiose goals

like OpenAI

it can be ego for some, sure, but for lots its trying to realize an extreme global care

i believe AGI benefiting all humanity, or this for example is feasible [How to Eradicate Global Extreme Poverty - YouTube]([How to Eradicate Global Extreme Poverty - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DUlYQTrsOs)) 

[What are the most pressing world problems?]([What are the most pressing world problems?]([What are the most pressing world problems?]([What are the most pressing world problems?](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/)))) AI risks, safeguaring pandemics, preventing nuclear war, climate change, coordination,...

is all the big transhumanist/scientific dreams that people pursure (solving cancer, immortality, direct or indirect mind upgrade (wellbeing, productivity, memory, computational power, intelligence,...), aging, quantum gravity,... etc.

dreaming big for the benefit of all from care is good IMO even if you have smaller probability of succeeding, ideally in group, but the probability of succeding is nonzero

if i didnt dream big i wouldnt be helping to do neurophenomeneology/AI research for two groups

i dislike the messages of people saying dont dream big, people were telling me that so much, and i f i listened i wouldnt be where i am right now and i wouldnt pursue what i wanna do soonish (learning ML engineering more, putting money from ML industry to effective charities, learning more mechanistic interpretability for steering LLMs, maybe helping more research there, maybe donating to it, maybe helping neurotech/science LLMs/etc,...), i wanna dream big, i care for big things, because i care for all people and want to maximize impact because of it so i am attempting to allocate my time towards that the most. you can also combine small and big altruistic goals

yes, i am often arguing that some people have unrealistic goals, if you wanna do big things you have to set up a concrete realistic path (thats part of effective altruism how to do that) so im trying to be the closest to realistic optimist (not naive by unrealistic goals or not being aware of what actual big problems exist and predicting there can be impactful things actually done because status quo isnt fixed) possible systematically supporting the most effective causes, so currently im in my phase of learning ML more deeply by learning and building more from Stanford's Andrew Ng's ML materials and then Deepmind's Neel Nanda's interpretability materials and i wanna help stuff i listed in previous msg soonish with those skills (or i was at local Pirates political party meeting yesterday where i might integrate into that I wouldnt be doing if i didnt dream big)

there are so many people dreaming giantly doing so much actual work and helping the world in practice thanks to it! altruistic ambition is the tool we have against sociopathic or other destructive forces that bring down the total amount of societal wellbeing, stability, flourishing and so on

If people caring for everyone wont dream big then in total bigger % of people caring for just themselves will dream big and create a worse world for all

and even if it fails one time, be realistically aware of probabilities of certain types of actions and try again, going small or big depending on what you want to tackle and where your capabilities, agency and care is, still attempting the most effectively if you want to, whatever happens never learning helplessness, collaborating with others

Many people underestimate a lot what actual potential impact, possibilities, capabilities, agency etc. they have by potentially acting that helps everyone and fall into for example "the bad developments in our world are fundamentally unchangeable".... Untrue! There are many ways how many people can impact the system in a big way on economical, cultural (bottomup, shaping culture by discourse), environmental, scientific and technological (from education to research to building foundations to building products and integrating it to society), governance level (topdown, local or global), or by movements that for example advocate for freedom,... all of which is happening daily everywhere! We live in a world that we collectively make for ourselves which affects us all and many existing forces are fightable, modifiable, can be made stronger etc. by many influences!

Timestamps from my fav YT vids to different parts of the text 

Lots of people blogging about xrisk and AI alignment do alignment/interpretability research with it (or other things with other risks) and this is how they share their results, or they have an educator role, community bulding role, or connect it with what implications it has in other parts of our system that then prolifiates into culture which shapes our thinking or they have a political role such that we maximize benefits of AI instead of harms etc., applying it in engineering etc., theres's lots of other dynamics with it

Or visions of grand unified theories motivate tons of scientists like Susskind, Carlo Rovelli, Carrol in physics, or Bilek in biophysics or Friston and Chris Fields in neurophysics, UTOK in psychology, etc. where their work has tons of practical results, or Qualia Research Institute and Active Inference Institute that I collaborate with

There are attemts at generalizing and formalizing morality that some attempt to apply in AI alignment research because understanding morality is needed for that in certain agendas

Or tons of existing neurotech exists because of people motivated by big transhumanist visions

Even Shrondinger, Turing or Neumann wanted to unify physics and biology very hard and every technology we use and tons of research among many disciplines is based on their findings thanks to it

Instead of iterative optimization like gradient descent, could you somehow jump in the loss function potential space to the local minima solution more directly, with some analytical methods, or is too messy for such analysis? Hmmm. I feel like existing dynamical systems/analysis/stat math could have something like that in it 
For simple functions its easy, but for complex ones like space of gigantic amount of parameters I suppose we just have these iterative techniques without shortcuts.

Hmm this looks good, but includes almost nothing on Transformers [[2310.20360] Mathematical Introduction to Deep Learning: Methods, Implementations, and Theory]([[2310.20360] Mathematical Introduction to Deep Learning: Methods, Implementations, and Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20360)) Mathematical Introduction to Deep Learning: Methods, Implementations, and Theory

We know basically nothing about the future. It's theoretically impossible. We can't predict extremely complex nonlinear dynamics of chaotic systems such as humanity. All the gazilions forces fighting for dominance can have gazilions of possible outcomes, their unknowable synergy will be the outcome. 

May AGI benefit all of humanity, including giving freedom on all levels to all beings.

A friendly reminder that in 2005 Kurzweil predicted that computers would pass the Turing Test by 2029, and set the date for a technological singularity at 2045. That seems pretty realistic at the moment.

"The answer isn't degrowth, but growth that maximizes planetary complexity while minimizing the degree to which any entropy not re-usable somewhere else as a source of free energy remains within planetary bounds"

Yes! We can expand to the universe, it can then become cosmic bounds! We can build Dyson spheres, safeguard against existencial and natural risks of sentience by mitigation and technology (no more natually induced existencial risks with powerful enough technology), build sentience aligned AGI helping us though this process, or eventually merging with it. This growth of life with meaning can go on infinitely, and we might even outsmart the second law of thermodynamics according to Dyson's eternal intelligence. 

I'm for transhumanist scientific and technological progress, sustainability and wellbeing (including sense of freedom) of all of sentience acceleration towards this path!

A proof and a theorem are easy. A statement is a program P,  (and a definition is a subroutine), proof is a witness that P always halts (cf. complexity class NP).

Theory is more fuzzy. One could say it is a conglomerate of "related" statements, definition and proofs.

But some ontologies are more pragmatic than others.
Hardcore disconnected dualism in practice seems to really go against the fact that we have some neural correlates to target in people for example with depression.
My assumption is so radically nondualist to advance neural correlate research as far as it will be possible for as much predicting and manipulation of brains and other conscious systems as possible.

how to learn the most effectively:
depends on the field, depends on the part of the learning process
gpt can ive intutive xplanations
gpt can be a tutor, follow though equations
gpt is more exact big body of strict knowledge
for some you need concrete books or math/physcourses
depends if you want mathematical or intitive understanding and of what 
so many variables IMO
many tools have their advantages and disadvantages, from gpt prompt engineering to reading wiki/books to watching lectures to various courses online or offline 
its better to combine the various tools for more efficiency

I'm curious why EM models of consciousness tend to not talk about other forces in the standard model. I suppose because they're much less common. What if they're also part of the consciousness dynamics equation as electromagnetism is everywhere in biological systems, but something still has to hold atoms together (strong force), certain radioactive isotopes are present in biological systems and decay (weak force), gravity is around every mass, and forces are interactions of matter so matter is needed in the equation as well.

Developing AGSI poses lots of harmful risks and potential failure modes for our system that may create suffering for all of sentience before or after AGSI is reached (opression, wars, extinction...), but if we get it right, there is a big potential for future where all of sentience flourishes with wellness.
Risks will always exist, its about minimizing them in the aggregate. If we dont develop AGSI soon, there might be higher probability of getting killed by other factors, like nukes, biorisk, nanotech risk, climate change, natural causes, or getting into opressive dystopia or chaotic breakdown full of tribal wars, with radical social, economic, technological or intelligence inequality, which itself might even be accelerated by AI, but all tools are dual use aka omni use, it might also be the other way around if we direct it correctly into a future where all sentient beings, maybe even beyond humans, flourish in wellness!

Can we comprehend all of physics, is it analyzable, is it computable? Even if we find undecidable functions in physics, like the spectral gap problem, we can still study the function's properties and therefore properties of the physical world.

I just can't see it. 

You get corporate dystopia limiting your (not only) economic freedom in anarchocapitalism as a result.
Let's assume anarchocapitalism starts with no inequality at the beggining. Some people are more lucky or better at capitalist games than others. Power laws distribution of wealth emerges and therefore giants with giant unregulated power of influence over others forms. You're now living in the Amazon empire.

=What is this book about=

Effective Individual And Collective Wellbeing Engineering for Survival and Flourishing!

I love thinking and writing about everything! 

I love exploring the nature of mind, wellbeing, meditation, psychedelics by cognitive science! Nonduality, love, fullfillment, selfactualization, peace, safety for all beings!

I love visioning humanity's (and consciousness beyond humans) utopian, dystopian or catastrophic futures and how to maximize the chances of the positive ones!

I love wondering how does artificial general intelligence work and what is its role in everything?

I love understanding everything using the language of mathematics, dynamical complex systems science, physics, statistics, information theory, cybernetics.

I love to ponder on epistemology and philosophy of science, I love bayesianism!

I love to explore the foundations of everything with philosophy, ontology, ethics, logic and mathematics!

I love generalist big picture thinking and unifying all sorts of fields and perspectives into one framework using science and philosophy!

What are the best habits, psychotechnologies, supplements, neurotechnology to reach optimal wellbeing, resilience, adaptibility and happiness of us and of all of consciousness as a whole? How to balance acceptance and change? How to increase productivity and agency. How to increase quality of learning and sensemaking?

What's the best model for all of science by unifying all existing or novel models in various fields supported by empirical evidence? What's the best, simplest, predictive, explanatory, practical model of physics, consciousness and intelligence that we can grasp? How to bridge between different specialized or general scientific camps in various fields or attempts at theories of everything? What are the best philosophical assumptions? How to design the best technology?

How to lock in positive futures where sentience flourishes? How to design protopia for everybeing? How to create conditions for compatible fulfillment of values, quality education, democracy, systems thinking, communication, truth, meaning, bliss, love, transcendence, freedom, enjoyment, compassion, togetherness, unity? 

How to prevent coordination failures? How to prevent humanity's failure modes in decision making that could make us extinct or strengthen crises? What crises people propose and what does the data imply? What existencial risks are more and more probable? What are the solutions to mitigating, preventing bad things from happening? How to solve causes and symptoms of the world's biggest problems? What to do if things already go bad? When trying to enact solutions, how to take in account that many people are trying many different things? How to adapt to any possible outcome? How to balance (not only) technological progress, sustainability, coordination and safety? 

How to bridge between different values and other deep assumptions of various fields, visions, movements, ideologies, religions, any memeplexes, any mental frameworks, in the framework of collective rational plus irrational information processing and sensemaking of agents with limited computational power, data and perspective when modelling the world's enormous growing complexity together to collectively flourish in the future? How can artificial intelligence help us?

How does the statespace of consciousness look like, what exotic states are possible? Can we experience any possible experiences? How much do psychedelics and meditation unlock? How does the edge of the mind look like? When you disintegrate into structureless infinite consciousness on psychedelics or/and meditation full of infinite relief and nothing makes sense anymore but everything makes sense at the same time as all mental faculties break down into death, how can you explain the beyond concepts beyond everything transcendental ieffable with language?

Imagine a future where we figured out how sense of meaningful life works and engineered it to everybeing. Imagine a future where we solved all of science and consciousness to such a degree that we can create anything we want and experience everything we want. Imagine a future where we understand biology and general sentience such that sentient beings can take any physical form that they wish or that is needed for collective survival and flourishing life infinitely and merge with eachother. Imagine a future where coordination failures have been solved and no things like climate change or nuclear war endanger our stability. Imagine a future where we reverse engineered suffering and no sentient beings suffer anymore. Imagine a future where all philosophical questions have been answered to a very a satisfying and practical degree, but there is still infinite novelty available for any being to experience. Imagine a future where not even second law of thermodynamics where everything goes towards decay endanger our stability. Imagine a future of infinitely flourishing transhumanist supercooperation cluster merging with nature and the whole universe. 

Omni/Acc = Steelman all scientific models, models of wellbeing+experience and movements shaping the future and synthesize them on a higher order of complexity as compatibly as possible for collective survival, wellbeing and flourishing of all beings! Let's integrate it all into one framework! Systems science, science, physics, information theory, consciousness, cognitive science, meditation, psychedelics, truth, agency, productivity, intelligence, artificial intelligence, humanity, values, visions, utopia, sociology, progress, risks, resilience, adaptibility, sustainability, freedom, education, coordination, our future! Join!

=Overview=

People have many competing perspectives on many things. The goal of this book is to collaboratively unify perspectives on wellbeing, science, making our system better, and some other thins. For example there are different traditions in psychology, different models of theories of everything in physics, or models of consciousness, or different lenses on how to make society well. I believe all those differing camps have a lot of potential for synthesis. I start from first principles, by analyzing deepest assumptions different perspectives make, and using common ground for unification. For example science wants the most predictive explanatory model connected to empirical evidence. Theraphy wants to make people feel well. Artificial intelligence field wants AI to do good. Competition has its advantages, such as driver for innovation, but too much of it can be more destructive than productive. Theoreticians tend to be overly commited to their particular model, not being as open to alternative approaches, such as theories of everything in physics or various meditation traditions, which misses lots of potential for useful new insights and collaboration. Time to integrate them all!

The goal of this book is to unify knowledge from philosophy and science to find the most optimal assumptions for sensemaking in relation to making society well long term!

My methodology is to first map out the landscape of models used in various fields that I know of and then I pick the concrete models that I evaluate as the most useful ones in relation to this book's goal. I start with mapping out models used in philosophy, then in science's philosophy context I map out models used in physics, in consciousness, and so on. I try to understand everything in terms of physics. Let's develop a unifying framework that understands it all!

=Topdown summary=

Here I map out the content of this book. If you're not familiar with the technical terms, they will be explained from first principles in the book. 

I first start with no assumptions at all. I map out lots of popular philosophical assumptions: ontologies, epistemologies, ethical theories, models of identity. I choose the most optimal set of assumptions for doing science: empiricism, bayesianism, epistemic humility, physicalism unified with computationalism, panpsychism, emergentism, pragmatism, wellbeing utilitarism, closed, empty and open individualism together. I map out foundations in science, such as logic: classicl, constructivist intuistionic homotopy type theory, and mathametical foundations: (ZFC) set theory, category theory I map out models used in physics: classical mechanics, statistical mechanics ((nonequilibirum) thermodynamics), information theory, relativity, cosmology, quantum mechanics, quantum information theory, and their unity: quantum field theory (axiomatic, standard model), quantum darwinism, spacetime from entaglement, loop quantum gravity, supersymemtry, string theory, holographic principle, asymtotic gravity, wolfram physics project, amplituhedron, quantum free energy principle, with the focus on standard model quantum field theory, but with spacetime from entaglement and quantum darwinism with classical and quantum free energy principle across scales using unity of superdeterminism and quantum bayesianism interpretations of physics. I map out approaches for weak emergence and studying system's dynamics on a higher more abstract level or using an approximation: Effective Field Theory, Renormalization Group, Pointcare Map, Petrubation theory, Free energy principle. I take scalefree laws: (quantum) free energy principle, classical physics (fluid dynamics, harmonic analysis) and other tools used in chemical physics, neurophysics, biophysics, social physics, econophysics to frame other scientific fields on other scales studying atoms, molecules, proteins, cells, neurons, functional brain regions, animals, people, communities, states, superpowers, planets, galaxies with their unique differential equations. I map out approaches to immortality. I map out models of neurophenomenology (empirically testable models of consciousness, sentience, sapience) with the focus on levels of analysis (implementational, algorithmic, computational, phenomenological): Predictive processing, free energy principle, Conductance-based model, Nonequilibrium quantum brain dynamics, Orchestrated objective reduction, Holonomic brain theory, Shrondinger's Neurons, Neural field theory, Integrated information theory, Global workspace theory, Adaptive resonance theory, Topological segmentation, Higher-order theories of consciousness, Reentry, Sensorimotor Theory. There I pick quantum free energy principle running on standard model quantum field theory combined with neural field theory bound by topological segmentation of information processing networks with perception of an observer and binding as general entaglement of two unseparable quantum computational systems interacting. I map out current paradigms in neuroscience. I map out what's the state of the art in AI: transformers, neuromorphic engineering, active inference. How do the biological intelligences compare to artificial intelligences: flexible adaptible architecture constructed from stratch in process of selforganization, resonance network governed by neural field theory, by evolution preinstalled priors and heuristics and metaheuristics to minimize training data, global emotional processing, metaawareness, embodiment, mutimodality, planning, less "autism", self and other model, learning change in dynamic qualia streams instead of static snapshots, metastable coherence in some ground truths, needs of being surviving in the universe with others instead of imitating text on the internet, being directed by hundreds of physiological, dozens of social and a few cognitive needs that are implemented as reflexes until we can partially transcend them and replace them with instrumental behavior that relate to our higher goals. Xenobots live on the boundary between biological and artificial machines. I map out causes and models of wellbeing: good Active Inference model, symmetry theory of valence, wellbeing at the edge of chaos, genes, adequate brain network connectivity for flexible adaptible communication, learning to relax, having accepting environment, having direction in life. I map out models for neurodiversity: autism, schizotypicity, ADHD, low and high energy depression, bipolar. I map out models for meaning, agency, free will, love and other psychological constructs. I map out models used in psychology (big five personality model), psychotheraphy (gestalt, internal family systems) and frame it in the statistical physics model. I map out models of meditation and psychedelics: focused attention, open monitoring, nondual, therapy, learning, intellectual exploration, experiental exploration, finding or creating meaning, rest, freeying dissolution, getting better local minina, tools to transform, weaken or strenghten topological beliefs through annealing: inquiry into topological structure of experience's epistemic agent hub catching sensations, mindfulness, love and kindness, gratefulness, deity visualization and merging, nondual love, nondual deconstruction, loving reconstruction. I map out conteplative traditions: Stoicism, Mindfullness, Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana, Zen, Taoism, Atthakavagga, Ajivika, Dzogchen, Postrationalism, QRI. I frame different assumptions our brains can assume in the meta context of cognitive science. I map out different popular mental frameworks, cultures (west, east) , religions (christianity, buddhism), ideologies (left, right). I map out models used in sociology with the focus on social physics, Active Inference, evolutionary game theory, gauge theory and levels of analysis: technology, economy, law, governance, culture. What makes the most succesful cultures: internal and external positive/zero/negative sum dynamics that do coordinated violence effectively at scale (before it was mostly physical, now it is mostly economic, diplomatic, technological,...) I map out crises: poverty, economical, housing, environmental, geopolitical, energy, immigration, eductional, sensemaking, capability, legitimacy, meaning, teen mental health, inequality. And risks: pandemics, cyberweapons, biotechnology, ecosystem collapse from climate change, nuclear war, sensemaking and coordination failures, population wellbeing decline, adaptability, loss of social cohesion, meaning, loneliness, polarization (culture war), food and water scarity, breakdown of essencial infrastructure, misuse of artificial intelligence or other powerful tools used as destructive weapons (mainly Cambridge Analytica like psychological mapping and exploiting ingroup polarizing manipulation on social media for political advantage), AI incopetence, unaligned artificial general superintelligence, failure to integrate economical and environmental migrants. I map out solutions to cooperation coordination failures (Moloch), polycrisis (interconnected web of crises), metacrisis (underlying pattern under crises) in general that I argue should work in synergy: strenghtening democracy, reform of economy, media, social media, laws (political economy), parenting, decarbonization, degrowth, environment (regenerative economy), mental health, technology, slow down/pause/stop automation, slow down/pause/stop AI, accelerate AI, AI safety (AI alignment, AI copilot, AGI overlord, not building AGI (without understanding existing AIs?), adapting to postA(G)I world with culture and governance, structure of cities, cultural transformation: moral circle expanding by compassion, unifying languages, visions ( togetherness in this world full of problems we face together, and shared good future utopian globalist vision), meaning, secular religion, destabilizing narrow attention by education or meditation, power checked benevolent governing structures (cooperative regulations), automation allowing universal basic income, game theoretically stable optional wireheading infrastructure, resilient foods and clean water, resilience to crises and risks, education (communication of all of this to relevant policymakers, politicians, wealthy impactful people (generating economic incentives), general public through schools and informal education, creating ground between academia, policymakers, stake holders, and general public), mass AI powered quality science and systems science and mental health education grounded in reality to fight epistemic breakdown and molochian multipolar traps, with the focus on exponential tech's AI, education, democracy, culture. I map out ways to prepare and solutions to symptoms of the metacrisis: infrastructure for if things go wrong to avoid extinction, things like carbon capture. I map out what to do when things go wrong: nuclear winter. I map out acions against the metacrisis: learn, find people, join projects, donate, propagate, spread, educate, recruit. I map out various future timelines: business as usual, global totality (Russia), chaos (Somalia), stable liberal democracy by educated disincentivizing overly competing shorttermist nonaltruistic sociopathic selfcentered uneducated cancerous agents on regenerative economy, extinction, degrowth, returning to old ways, supergrowth with transhumanist transcendental longtermist utopia. I think about the current state of science with replication crisis under everything, where standard model quantum field theory is the best science we have, not forgeting bayesianism with epistemic humility, and seeing sociology and a lot of our models in general as more about forming the future than predicting it, arguing that us having fundamental assumption that future can be shaped into turning out well also increases the chances of that actually happening, making doom unjustified. I map out ways to solve humanity's biggest issues while not burning out and keeping good mental health: learning to apprecitate the present moment and sacredness of life, learning to rest, regenerate, get stronger where learning to temporarily turn of all structures in the brain with focus on those encoding what might be going wrong in society, inducing motivation by becoming in love with and adding to the beauty of life, becoming integral part of it. I end it with my story and transcendence into nondual love for all that is!

[[File:Futureofagi.jpg|1000px|Alt text]]

A meme where I tried to steelman various big voices in the future of artificial general intelligence discourse and put them on a political compass meme where various hot takes lie on the spectrum of mainly focusing on probability of AI doom versus probability of AI utopia scenarios and how expanded one's moral circle of concern is across space, time, and systems.

=Newest book version=

Beggining technical note: Each chapter is divided into:

- Layman description: If you want just very simplified highlevel less technical overview, this might be for you.

- Description only in introduced language and concepts that is linear, bottomup: This will try to present each chapter from first principles n as linearly structured form as possible. Read this first if you're not familiar with most concepts used in the other ones.

- Description only in introduced language and concepts that is nonlinear, bottomup: This will be mostly used to unify previous chapters, which is done in nonlinear way.

- Description in all concepts that is nonlinear, topdown: This will assume knowledge of many concepts before introducting them, which might be useful if you already have a certain background for the concepts!

- Main links: Main resources on which the chapter is build on, you can start here ass well.

Let's delve into physics. 

Wikipedia's definition of physics is: The natural science of matter, involving the study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force.

We will slowly build all machinery used to predict motion of objects. If you're not familiar with any of these, wait for other chapters. 

Classical mechanics studies average sized objects moving at average speeds - speeds are much lower than the speed of light, sizes are much greater than that of atoms, yet very small in astronomical terms. Relativistic mechanics studies big objects moving at fast speed. Quantum mechanics studies small objects moving at slow speeds. Quantum field theory, a type of relativistic quantum mechanics, unification of special relativity and quantum mechanics, studies small objects at high speeds - Standard model maps out fundamental particles and forces on the lowest level of reality. We still can't unify gravity (general relativity) with quantum mechanics, which connects to other unsolved issues in physics, but there are many proposed solutions waiting to be verified. This distinction isn't perfect, as we have edgecases like measured quantum entanglement of particles that are kilometers apart, but its good enough approximation for most of usecases. We can technically use only relativistic quantum mechanics everywhere, but at other scales and speeds, relativistic quantum mechanics becomes mostly equivalent with just classical or relativistic mechanics, which is easier to work with. There is also generalized quantum theory paradigm for information processing by complex systems such as the brain, that takes into account contextual dependence of information and probabilistic reasoning, that can be mathematically described in the framework of quantum information and quantum probability theory, which is not reliant on the hypothesis that there is something micro-physical quantum-mechanical about the brain.

===Science -> Technology -> Statistical methods -> Metaheuristics -> Simulated annealing===

Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function in similar way how annealing works in metallurgy by cooling the temperature slowly the approximate global maximum is found. Where there are many local maxima, it is not enough to use a simple hill climb algorithm, and simulated annealing can be used instead.

[Feedforward neural network - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network)

A feedforward neural network is a basic type of artificial neural network where connections between nodes do not form a cycle, allowing information to move in only one direction, from input to output.

===Science -> Technology -> Artificial Intelligence -> Paradigms -> Nonsymbolic aka Connectionist -> Artificial neural networks -> Recurrent neural network===

[Recurrent neural network - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)

A recurrent neural network is like a looped decision-making process, where each decision considers not only the current information but also what was learned from previous data points, making it well-suited for tasks involving sequences like language or time series data.

More formally, it's a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence, allowing it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior and process sequences of inputs.

===Science -> Technology -> Artificial Intelligence -> Paradigms -> Nonsymbolic aka Connectionist -> Artificial neural networks -> Long short-term memory===

Long short-term memory (LSTM) network is a recurrent neural network (RNN), aimed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem present in traditional RNNs. Its relative insensitivity to gap length is its advantage over other RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods. It aims to provide a short-term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps, thus "long short-term memory".

===Science -> Technology ->  Artificial Intelligence -> Paradigms -> Nonsymbolic aka Connectionist -> Artificial neural networks -> Symmetries and Geometric deep learning===

Deep learning is hard. While universal approximation theorems show that sufficiently complex neural networks can in principle approximate ‚Äúanything‚Äù, there is no guarantee that we can find good models.

Great progress in deep learning has nevertheless been made by judicious choice of model architectures. These model architectures encode inductive biases to give the model a helping hand. One of the most powerful inductive biases is to leverage notions of geometry, giving rise to the field of geometric deep learning.

Fundamentally, geometric deep learning invovles encoding a geometric understanding of data as an inductive bias in deep learning models to give them a helping hand.

Traditional deep learning focuses on Euclidean data (like images, text, and audio), which can be represented in regular grids. In contrast, geometric deep learning deals with non-Euclidean data such as graphs and manifolds.

While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, many tasks are not uniform and have strong repeating patterns as a result of the low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. 

Geometric Deep Learning unifies a broad class of ML problems from the perspectives of symmetry and invariance. These principles not only underlie the breakthrough performance of convolutional neural networks and the recent success of graph neural networks but also provide a principled way to construct new types of problem-specific inductive biases: Symmetry and invariance, Stability, Multiscale representations.

This new approach, known as the Forward-Forward algorithm, is inspired by our understanding of neural activations in the brain. brain doesn't seem to do back propagation used by traditional artificial neural networks. Instead of relying on the traditional forward and backward passes of backpropagation, this method utilizes two forward passes ‚Äî one with positive, real data and the other with negative data. Each layer in the network has its own objective function, which is to have high ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù for positive data and low ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù for negative data.

Used for ChatGPT.

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a technique that trains a "reward model" directly from human feedback and uses the model as a reward function to optimize an agent's policy using reinforcement learning (RL). The reward model is trained in advance to the policy being optimized to predict if a given output is good (high reward) or bad (low reward). 

More intuitively it's like giving the LLM a bunch of "yes" or "no" feedback on its actions and then training it to do more of the "yes" stuff.

Some people want intelligence as similar to humans as possible, so they try to make the hardware and software architecture as similar to the brain as possible, some one more "unrestricted" or "alien" intelligence and see what other engineering hacks or mathematically maybe more optimal methods work, and the equilibrium we have currently is our biggest models being giant stacks of transformers with lots of small optimization improvements and tons of pre and postprocess filtering (RLHF) that are mainly in the language modality running on classical GPU chips optimized for linear algebra computing.

I have mentioned many more human inspired architectures already, such as Active Inference, Yann LeCun's Image Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, or Geoffrey Hinton's Forward-Forward Algorithm. There are more attempts.

===Science -> Technology -> Artificial Intelligence -> Intersection between AI and biological systems and comparisions -> Spiking neural network===

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks that more closely mimic natural neural networks. SNNs incorporate the concept of time into their operating model. The idea is that neurons in the SNN do not transmit information at each propagation cycle (as it happens with typical multi-layer perceptron networks), but rather transmit information only when a membrane potential‚Äîan intrinsic quality of the neuron related to its membrane electrical charge‚Äîreaches a specific value, called the threshold. When the membrane potential reaches the threshold, the neuron fires, and generates a signal that travels to other neurons which, in turn, increase or decrease their potentials in response to this signal. A neuron model that fires at the moment of threshold crossing is also called a spiking neuron model.

Neuromorphic computing is an approach to computing that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. A neuromorphic computer/chip is any device that uses physical artificial neurons to do computations. In recent times, the term neuromorphic has been used to describe analog, digital, mixed-mode analog/digital VLSI, and software systems that implement models of neural systems (for perception, motor control, or multisensory integration).

===Science -> Humanity -> Phenomena -> Causal power inequality===

Causal power inequality means that an agent has more possibilities than other agents - let it be more resources, or economical, technological or cultural power, priveledges. This can be good or bad depending on context: everyone should have access to water if you're a humanist, but not everyone should have access to same amount of money, if you see value in economical competition, where those who succeed in it deserve their wealth. And its caused by different causes: pursuing economical progress based on playing fairly in economic system and producing for example technological value, altruistically or not, or by exploiting the system's loopholes. 

===Science -> Humanity -> Phenomena -> Multipolar traps===

This concept from game theory shows up everywhere as we discuss various crises and risks.

Multipolar traps aka Moloch is a risk that is under lots of other risks driving lots of crises.

Moloch is the personification of the forces that coerce competing individuals to take actions which, although locally optimal, ultimately lead to situations where everyone is worse off. Moreover, no individual is able to unilaterally break out of the dynamic. The situation is a bad Nash equilibrium. A trap. 

One example of a multipolar trap, a Molochian dynamic, is a Red Queen race between scientists who must continually spend more time writing grant applications just to keep up with their peers doing the same. Through unavoidable competition, they have all lost time while not ending up with any more grant money. And any scientist who unilaterally tried to not engage in the competition would soon be replaced by one who still does. If they all promised to cap their grant writing time, everyone would face an incentive to defect. [https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/moloch Moloch definition of LessWrong]

More examples are the Prisoner's Dilemma, dollar auctions, overfishing, Malthusian trap, capitalism, two-income trap, agriculture, arms races (technology, nuclear weapons), races to the bottom, education system, science, and government corruption and corporate welfare.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Political compass===

The political compass is a multi-axis political model used to label or categorize political ideologies.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Political compass -> Economic axis===

Left-Right (Economic) Axis: This axis represents economic ideologies. The left side (often represented in red) typically signifies socialist or communist ideologies, advocating for more government control or regulation of the economy, wealth redistribution, and public ownership of resources. The right side (often in blue) represents capitalist or free-market ideologies, advocating for less government intervention in the economy, private ownership, and free-market principles.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Political compass -> Social axis===

Authoritarian-Libertarian (Social) Axis: This axis represents views on personal and social freedoms. The top of the axis (authoritarian) indicates a preference for more controlled or regulated social environments, where the government has a significant role in dictating or influencing social behavior. This can include support for strict law enforcement, traditional values, and centralized power. The bottom of the axis (libertarian) represents a preference for individual liberty, personal choice, and minimal government intervention in private life.

When these axes intersect, they form four quadrants:

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Political compass -> Authoritarian Left===

Authoritarian Left: This quadrant combines economic left-wing views with authoritarian social policies. It might include support for a planned economy alongside a preference for controlled social order and centralized power.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Political compass -> Authoritarian Right===

Authoritarian Right: This quadrant combines economic right-wing views with authoritarian social policies. It often includes support for a free-market economy along with a desire for a structured social order, possibly with traditional values.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Political compass -> Libertarian Left===

Libertarian Left: This quadrant combines left-wing economic views with libertarian social policies. It typically includes support for a more egalitarian economic system (like socialism) coupled with a strong emphasis on personal freedoms and civil liberties.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Political compass -> Libertarian Right===

Libertarian Right: This quadrant combines right-wing economic views with libertarian social policies. It often includes support for a free-market economy along with a high degree of personal and social freedom, minimal government intervention, and individualism.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state===

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> Economical axis===

Left (More State Control): Many countries in the world, especially those in the developing world or with socialist leanings, favor stronger state involvement in the economy. This includes aspects like welfare systems, state-owned enterprises, and economic planning.

Right (More Market Freedom): On the other hand, the global trend, particularly in developed countries and emerging economies, has been leaning towards free-market capitalism. This includes policies that favor privatization, deregulation, and open markets.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> Social axis===

Authoritarian: Several regions and countries exhibit authoritarian tendencies, where governments exert substantial control over many aspects of life, restrict freedoms, and maintain power through centralized control.

Libertarian: Conversely, many countries, especially in the West, prioritize individual liberties, democracy, and personal freedoms, promoting a more libertarian approach.

I'm gonna focus mainly on USA, Europe, China, Russia and India, as those are the biggest players in AI. Middle East, Africa, South America, Oceania or rest of Asia are also big players that are very diverse politically, you can look into them separately.

The USA generally falls on the right side of the economic axis, favoring free-market capitalism. However, there are significant variations within the country, with some advocating for more government intervention in the economy.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> United States of America -> Social axis===

Socially, the USA is diverse, with a mix of libertarian and authoritarian viewpoints. While there are strong libertarian traditions emphasizing individual freedoms, there are also trends towards social conservatism and, in some areas, increased state control over certain social issues.

Europe is diverse, but many countries lean towards the left on the economic axis, favoring social democratic policies with more state welfare and regulatory involvement in the economy compared to the USA.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> Europe -> Social axis===

On the social axis, European countries tend to be more libertarian, especially in Western Europe, with a strong emphasis on individual rights, personal freedoms, and progressive social policies. However, variations exist, and some Eastern European countries can lean more authoritarian.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> China===

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> China -> Economic axis===

China presents a complex picture. While officially a communist state, its economic reforms have introduced elements of market capitalism, especially in urban and coastal areas. However, the state still retains significant control over key industries and economic policy.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> China -> Social axis===

On the social axis, China is more authoritarian. The Chinese government maintains strict control over many aspects of social life, including the media, internet, and public expression, reflecting a top-down approach to governance and social order.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> Russia===

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> Russia -> Economic axis===

Russia's economy has elements of market capitalism, especially after the fall of the Soviet Union, but the state still retains significant control over major industries and economic policy, placing it towards the center or slightly left on the economic axis.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> Russia -> Social axis===

On the social axis, Russia leans towards the authoritarian end. The government under Vladimir Putin has tightened control over media, political freedoms, and civil liberties, reflecting a top-down approach to governance.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> India===

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> India -> Economic axis===

India's economy has been moving towards the right on the economic axis since economic liberalization in the 1990s, promoting market economy and private sector involvement. However, the state still plays a significant role in certain sectors.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> India -> Social axis===

Socially, India is a democratic nation with a strong emphasis on civil liberties and political freedoms, placing it towards the libertarian end. However, there are ongoing challenges related to social inequality, religious tensions, and regional disparities.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> Global===

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> Global -> Economic axis===

Given these opposing trends, the global average might fall somewhere in the center of the economic axis, reflecting a mix of market economies with varying degrees of state intervention.

===Science -> Humanity -> Governance -> Present state -> Global -> Social axis===

Globally, there might be a slight tilt towards the authoritarian side, considering the population sizes of countries with more authoritarian governance (like China). However, the global trend has been gradually shifting towards more democratic and libertarian values over the past few decades, influenced by globalization, international human rights norms, and digital connectivity.

Global AI safety summit happened, where all major AI companies agreed to not publish dangerous models, but different companies made slightly different commitments on controllability, biorisk, etc., but Google said "we will proceed only where we believe that the benefits substancially outweigh the risks".

Processes emerge in evolutionary competition and eventually dissolve. Let it be galaxies, planets, species, organisms, societies, cultures, governing entities, learning scientific knowledge, technological progress,...

In history we went from tribal wars to monarchies and much more as responces to eachother, taking an opposite turn or synthetizing, you can Google all entities mentioned here [[The History of the World: Every Year - YouTube]([The History of the World: Every Year - YouTube](https://youtu.be/-6Wu0Q7x5D0)) The History of the World: Every Year - Youtube], where each entity, like kingdoms, empires, totalitarian and democratic states and so on, can be seen as different sociocultural economic technological interacting Markov blankets.

Let's explore what ideologies and movements as forces shaping the world emerged in evolutionary competition and what have the currently biggest influence on the evolution of humanity, or all of sentience in general, what forces pose risk to our system's sustainability and what are the solutions that are being enacted, and what are the potential utopian futures if we go through the artificial intelligence revolution correctly.

Control is a statistical force in a dynamical system that is centralized (dictatorship, king, totalitarian regime), semidecentralized(democracy, competing corporations, nationstates), decentralized (anarchy, anarchocommunism, anarchocapitalism, direct (digital) democracy) (spectrum) by:

battling or cooperating government/s (chosen by people not directly in control), king/s (not chosen, permanent family), corporation/s (emergent economically), person/s (emergent culturally), techgiant/s (emergent technologically, control via technology (AI companies of the future)), other authorities (science, philosophy,...) (or some combination on a spectrum)

which is more individualistic (with diverse forces competing or cooperating in harmony)(anarchocapitalism, competing nations) or collectivistic (similar forces merging into one) (anarchocommunism, communist dictatorship) (bottomup collectivism/individualism vs topdown collectivism/individualism)

or technology will allow humans merging into collective hivemind brain governing or being wireheaded

or instead of us controlling or coexisting, technology (AI) or nature (earth life) or alien species or universe (natural causes, entropy) (or some combination on a spectrum) governs us or destroys us or we merge with or become it (are you ready to become collective hivemind merging with artificial general superintelligence and then merging with Gaia and then eventually the whole universe becoming pure transhumanecolovium matter, all values included, your qualia pocket will be transported to a multiverse branch custom tailored to perfectly satisfy them) (or some combination on a spectrum), or humans or all of life goes extinct from existencial risks

on culture (regionism, nationalism, globalism, humanism, sentientism), economy (regulated, free market, crypto), technology (regulated, free progress, gov investments, transparency, closed source to prevent harm, open sourcing for democratization and innovation), environment (regulating its breakdown, not caring about it, it affecting us), science (gov investments), philosophy (or some combination on a spectrum)

all of that has certain end goal: stays in its current state (conservatism), accelerated change as fast as possible (progressivism) (growth, degrowth, transformation (one culture to other)) given different conditions (considering various risks ultimately vs not at all)(spectrum) (or some combination on a spectrum)

according to different ethical value systems (humans, nations, races, animals, technology, AIs, sentient matter, intelligence, capital, nature, environment, science, nothing, antinatanilism) 

which creates different levels of environmental, economical, technological, cultural sustainability (environmental, wellbeing of humans, animals, no big existencial risks, wars, or sustainability of intelligence could mean accelerate AI at all costs replacing us if that wont lead to destruction of most of advanced intelligence instead), wellbeing (sadness from opression (of individuals or nations) and less freedom to do and express by regulations and monitoring, happiness with government and its culture and economic regulation for benefit of people, sadness from not being told what to do, happiness from total freedom to do anything) transformation and risks (existencial (bioweapons, cyberweapons, pandemics, nanotech, nukes, climate change, social and sensemaking disintegration, fragility of fundamental infrastructure, AI (accelerating other risks, alignment, uncontrollability, being too powerful and easy to get and used as weapon, misinformation, manipulation, censorship, stabilizing authroitian regime, collapsing existing safeguards and our overall systems too fast))) to different valued entities 

that has a degree of stability depending on the influence of all the other forces (current positions of leaders in power are storngly stabilized by tons of safety checks, emerging attempts at seizing power get halted fast, overly corrupted governments can disintegrate, existencial risks can disintegrate it all, inability to adapt to technologcal progress is transformative on social, economic, cultural levels)

In general, control in the world is a set of forces, that have origin with a structure on a centralized to decentralized spectrum, each acting on different sets of variables

Force (ideology) consists of existing unwanted forces (free bad risky to all agents, too much regulations halting progress, polarization, distrust), existing wanted forces (healthcare and social support, not totally controlled market, attempts to revolute, intelligence explosion), proposed wanted forces (more coordination, progress in science, technology, meaningful jobs and overall activities for all, automation of boring stuff, privacy, autonomy, wellbeing, progress, sustainability, unity, diversity, good education for all, inclusivity, rational planetary decision making, sustainable growth, efficiency, security, meaningful community, shared resources, UBI, deserved resources, individual freedom, nation freedom, global coordination against risks, monitoring biorisk, benevolent altruistic governance, intelligence enhancement, transhumanism, connection with nature, bliss, good people in influencal entities, converting the whole universe into wellbeingium (matter experiencing only wellbeing, meaning, connection, novelty, sacredness, love, creativity, interestingsness, knowledge, selfactualization, truth, bliss, pleasure, peace, equaminity, safety, positive valence) with no more sufferium), proposed unwanted forces (suffering, extinction, global or local oppresion, violence, inequality (on economical, cultural, technological, knowledge, intelligence levels), radical jobloss in capitalist economy, regulatory capture, social fragmentation, bad mental health, loneliness, blind arms race, overdependence on technology AI and other things, overregulation, overmonitoring, disintegration of safety checks) proposed forces to achieve wanted forces (renewable energy, carbon pricing, AI governance, biorisk monitoring infratsructure, support for startups, support for people that cannot add economic value, donating to good causes, helping good causes, politically supporting good causes, teaching about good causes, creating infrastructure for good causes, creating conditions for good causes, voting, researching, engineering), existing forces to achieve wanted forces (charities, science labs, tech labs, good elected politicians, good people in influental entities), existing bottleneck forces (sociopaths having manipulative advantages in power (economic, governing, status), changing current state takes long transformation, skills, money, power, power in numbers of people), and their interactions with all other forces (accelerate technology vs pause technology, free vs governed technology and economy, traditional values vs trancending humanity)

Each force is made out of other lower level forces and creates other higher level forces.

In practice, political systems include gazilions of such interacting forces that forms them (international coordination entities, national governments, regional governments, interacting corporations, technology, the people, structure of your brain)

Getting acceptance or resistance that weakens or reinforces them from other forces. 

Total centralization isnt worth it, as one person alone is weak, he has to have a semicentralized group aligned with his interests.

Absolute centralization would be one atom governing the whole universe.

Absolute decentralization would be all atoms having the same degree of causal power on every other atom like any other atom.

			Stability: "Fades away overtime" (given population memory and anti global coordination forces)

			Interactions with other forces (predicted or real):

				Competing, Cooperating, Disallowing, Reinforcing

	Existing bottleneck forces:

		"With the enormous size of humanity and existing control being rooted everywhere, creating more global coordination requires tons of people acting from many sides for a change"

===Science -> Humanity -> Possible futures===

===Science -> Humanity -> Possible futures -> Governing technology===

Technology will probably be the most influencing factor of the future.

We can let technological progress evolve without any restrictions or totally control and regulate or totally stop it. Something in the middle will happen, but what kind of middle is the question. Predicting the capabilities and externalities of technology and how it will edit our system is hard to predict.

===Science -> Humanity -> Possible futures -> Governing technology -> Regulate and control everything

Depending on if you see emerging AI technology as powerful as scissors, or the internet, or like the nuclear weapons, you will have different views on how controllable and potentially harmful it is. Some people propose that its fundamentally uncontrollable, or that in its usage, the harmful uses will be much bigger factor than the 

===Science -> Humanity -> Possible futures -> Governing technology -> Open source everything

We can let technological progress evolve without any restrictions, but we risk the chances of it not being sustainable and us selfdestrucing ourselves on all levels in the extreme. We should probably steer it at least in some way to prevent some of the risks. Some people argue that all of that is bad. Some people argue that we need to accelereate AI in order to solve all other existencial risks like climate change, nukes, biorisk etc. by solving all of science and politics that way, but others argue that will only accelerate all these other risks. Both is possible, middle way will probably happen, but what kind of middle way? Some people argue we are fundamentally unsistainable and us selfdestrucing as fast as possible is the only way, as AI replacing us will save us.

[What‚Äôs The Difference between Utopia, Eutopia and Protopia? - Metamoderna](https://metamoderna.org/whats-the-difference-between-utopia-eutopia-and-protopia/)

‚ÄúUtopia‚Äù means ‚Äúnowhere‚Äù and denotes a static state of cultural and political perfection: society when it has become as good as it possibly can get. As nebulous and dreamy as Utopia might seem, it always implies a certain attained perfection of society. As such, there is the ‚Äúbad‚Äù now and the ‚Äúgood‚Äù future and the path from darkness into light.

===Science -> Humanity -> Possible futures -> Eutopia===

‚ÄúEutopia‚Äù is similar to utopia, it means ‚Äúthe good place‚Äù. What one deems as ‚Äúgood‚Äù, others might find ‚Äúbad‚Äù. The key is to make general enough definition of "good", such that everyone, when experiences it, agrees on it, thanks to for example reverengineering the mechanism by which our brain classifies the state of our world as good or bad and finding the common pattern and potentially hacking it in the next mentioned transhumanist utopia.

===Science -> Humanity -> Possible futures -> Protopia===

‚ÄúProtopia‚Äù is defined as the opposite of a ‚ÄúDystopia‚Äù. In Dystopia, people are stuck in some kind of recurring pattern of suffering (like George Orwell‚Äôs ‚Äúfoot trampling a human face forever‚Äù, as in 1984). A Protopian society, then, is one where people are free from such gridlocks and can thus work actively to improve life. It‚Äôs a more carefully stated form of a dream of societal transformation: It doesn‚Äôt say that ‚Äúeverything will be good for everyone‚Äù; it focuses not on the state-of-things-at-a-given-moment, but on the possibility - the shared capacity to move in mutually desirable directions. Simply stated, one could say that a Protopian society is one that has the capacity to become incrementally better as a result of the freedom of its members.

===Science -> Humanity -> Possible futures -> Naturalism===

In naturalism, we became one with the nature

===Science -> Humanity -> Possible futures -> Utopia===

in transhumanist utopia, thanks to technology, all science is solved, all technology for the benefit of all sentient beings is implemented.

The whole universe has been converted into wellbeingium (matter experiencing only wellbeing, meaning, selfactualization, truth, bliss, pleasure, peace, equaminity, safety, jhanas, positive valence) and there's no more sufferium.

===Intro===

This book is my bottomup reality building metaframework inside which I am putting all knowledge, a giant hetearchical tree of what we can dream up.

Let's build science from bottom up. We will start with laying the ground for the dynamics of fundamental particles of our universe. We will start with freedom for any thought and language, but then find the best philosophical assumptions for science, philosophical foundations for mathematics, then mathematical foundations for physics and then slowly build up the mathematics of our best empirically proven model of the universe: The standard model, a type of quantum field theory until we reach it in it's glory. 

Then we will look at higher scales, what mathematics governs chemistry, biology, consciousness (meditation, psychedelics, wellbeing), society (sociology, economics, technology, risks and crises, our future), up to astrophysics and cosmology.

At the end I will explore what possible future awaits us as humanity and how to get the best ones!

I was wondering if i should bottom up build physical reality as i do it now, first building math and explaining fundamental particles and cosmology (classical -> quantum -> relativity -> merging to QTF standard model), and then go to middle scales such as biology and sociology.

Or should i bottom up build math (when i mention dynamical systems and classical mechanics i say everywhere where its applied, from small particles to big ones, as most of science is in classical framework, and explaining fundamental particles at the end because thats where i get to QTF math).

If i should go into biology when i already explain enough math (most of it is classical so including it inside classical dynamical systems), or if i should postpone it after i explain fundamental physics fully first.

Or first build all math without practically applying and then do a big section on just applications? But without examples that can be hard to grasp, and its almost impossible not to use examples when explaining physics without it seeming too abstract.

It's probably better to keep the scientific fields together, instead of keeping maths together, I will do that.

===No assumptions, Any knowledge, Arbitrary structure or structurelessness===

Arbitrary structure or structurelessness (if you make any noises, any movements, any drugs, all experience with arbitrary structure or structurelessness counts in this category)

===Languages===

Languages: Structure constrained by vague or formal regularities (those regularities can be analyzed by all sorts of maths from for example information theory, but more on that later)

===Philosophy===

Philosophy: Language constrained by trying to explain something, vaguely or strictily formally

===Mathematics===

Mathematics: Philosophy constrained by strict formal definitions and rules (logic studies those rules) studying arbitrary relations between arbitrary things or inner structure of things 

===Science, Mostly applied mathematics===

Applied mathematics is mathematics constrained by making predictions about reality (part of systems science and mathematical physics), which is most of my favorite science. Science expressed in the language of mathematics makes very concrete predictions and can be simulated! Science can also have vague linguistic structures, lots of frameworks in psychology or social science are less mathematical and more forming reality instead of predicting it, that is also fine!

now we have a model of fundamental particles of the universe, let's go up

+ We can but don't have to use various mathematical machinery to emerge across scales, from small objects (mostly living in quantum math) to average objects (mostly living in classical math) to massive objects (mostly living in relativistic math), with effective field theory, renormalization group, pointcare map, petrubation theory:
- Absolute space and time: Systems science and classical mechanics, with linear algebra and all other sorts of maths, where most average sized objects in average speed mostly live - most science go here - chemistry, biology, cognitive science, engineering, social sciences and so on (lots of frameworks in psychology or social science are less mathematical and more forming reality instead of predicting it), works scalefree, we can use stuff like fluid mechanics, annealing, cybernetics and so on - unifying math is classical free energy principle
Small things can have effects on avarage sized things, some quantum biology or quantum consciousness models fuckery goes here
+ emerge more
- Relative spacetime: General relativity, where most massive objects or close to speed of light mostly live in, cosmology
maybe relativistic theory of consciousness?
Quantum free energy principle unifies all scales and fields in one abstract quantum information theoretic framework but doesn't solve all unsolved concrete problems in all the various fields but can help with that a lot!


===Technical note===

Each chapter is divided into:

- Layman description: If you want just very simplified highlevel less technical overview, this might be for you.

- Description only in introduced language and concepts that is linear, bottomup: This will try to present each chapter from first principles n as linearly structured form as possible. Read this first if you're not familiar with most concepts used in the other ones.

- Description only in introduced language and concepts that is nonlinear, bottomup: This will be mostly used to unify previous chapters, which is done in nonlinear way.

- Description in all concepts that is nonlinear, topdown: This will assume knowledge of many concepts before introducting them, which might be useful if you already have a certain background for the concepts!

- Main links: Main resources on which the chapter is build on, you can start here ass well.

===Science -> Physics -> Quantum -> Quantum mechanics===

Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization); objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave‚Äìparticle duality); and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).

===Science -> Physics -> Unity -> Relativistic quantum mechanics -> Quantum field theory===

Quantum field theory is relativistic quantum mechanics in which elementary particles are interpreted as field quanta.

Quantum field theory combines classical field theory, special relativity, and quantum mechanics together, but without gravity, which comes in general relativity that's not included.

===Science -> Physics -> Unity -> Relativistic quantum mechanics -> Quantum field theory -> Gauge theory===

Gauge theories are general clas of quantum field theories used for the description of elementary particles and their interactions using group theory.

A type of field theory in which the Lagrangian, and hence the dynamics of the system itself, do not change under local transformations according to certain smooth families of operations (Lie groups). Formally, the Lagrangian is invariant.

In a gauge theory there is a group of transformations of the field variables (gauge transformations) that leaves the basic physics of the quantum field unchanged. This condition, called gauge invariance, gives the theory a certain symmetry, which governs its equations. In short, the structure of the group of gauge transformations in a particular gauge theory entails general restrictions on the way in which the field described by that theory can interact with other fields and elementary particles.

We can take the statespace of things that science analyzes and map out the statespace of mathematics used to analyze them all, and semantic content framing it, automatically by scanning all of science information on the internet using scraping and data summarizing and compressing AI in a giant lookup table or or semantic map or fuzzy nested metagraph with nodes as things and (fuzzy) relations encoding similarityness, inclusion, connection, hiearchies, causality etc. Disciplines as evolutionary attractors in scientific progress can be mapped out by semantic similarity algorithms and dimensional reduction clustering.

What pullback attractor in the statespace of consciousness, or statespace of generative models, or slice of Ruliad, or dynamics of interacting and merging Markov blankets, topological pockets, physics, information, or what part of platonic mathematics, or God, nature, ieaffble, or all possible ontologies, or imaginings, constructions, are "you" inhabiting?

Our minds are free to think anything about reality! In the beggining before thinking about anything, there is just full potential, where anything can become true. Let's explore various ways of looking at the world in different stories we tell ourselves.

It is totally arbitrary, but some dreamed up constructs are more useful in different contexts than others.

===No assumptions, any knowledge -> Description in all concepts===

In the ultimately deconstructed state, our minds are free to think anything about reality, they can have any bayesian priors in the statespace of consciousness.

In the beggining before thinking about anything, there is just full potentiality, there is a mental model superposition of everything being neither true nor not true, meaning that classical logic itself is another rulebased construction that can be transcended.

As we explore the world we collapse this superposition into various concrete forms as we explore various ways of looking at the world in divfferent stories we tell ourselves.

(Monism) Is physics fundamental and mind emerges from it? (Physicalism) Is mind fundamental and physics emerge from it? Are laws of physics inside the mind? (Idealism) Are laws of physics actually laws of consciousness? Is all matter conscious? (Panpsychist physicalism) Is something third fundamental? (Neutral monism) Is information fundamental?

(Rationalism) Build by experiences and reflections on them? (Constructivism) Is a proposition true according to how much practical consequences it has? (Pragmatism) Is there inherent uncertainity to the possibility of having certain knowledge? (Skepticism) Is knowledge built upon a foundation of basic self-evident truths or experiences? (Foundationalism) Are beliefs justified if they cohere or fit well with other beliefs within a system? (Coherentism) Is truth and knowledge not absolute and varies depending on culture, society, or individual perspectives? (Relativism) Does the strength of a signal determine how true it feels? Do conscious systems see reality as it is or just some abstract approximated representation of it, or its not reality at all?

==Philosophy -> For science==

===Philosophy -> For science -> Description only in introduced language and concepts that is linear, bottomup===

For science I'm gonna assume empiricism that assumes that truthness of a model is determined by its predictive and explanatory power guided by occam's razor. 

Then baysianism that assumes that this model is slowly determined by slow updating of its structure according to what evidence in empirical data are presented. For example seeing a giant flying pink unicorn is not matching my probability of seeing a unicorn, so assuming I'm not high on psychedelics I might update my "probability of seeing a unicorn" model to higher than 0. [[How to systematically approach truth - Bayes' rule - YouTube](https://youtu.be/4hHA-oqpNig) How to systematically approach truth - Bayes' rule by Rational Animations on Youtube]

All our models we assume are finding regularities in some dynamics by useful approximations.

Concrete empirical measurements and the predictive mathematical models build on top of them is the ultimate minimization of vagueness, filtering signal out of noise.

Though measurement outcomes still depends on what tools we use to measure and what mathematical and philosophical assumptions we use to contextualize them in.

===Philosophy -> For science -> Description in all concepts that is nonlinear, topdown===

For science, I'm gonna asssume by empirical bayesianism constructed approximating model of reality in physicalist combination of quantum physics and quantum information theory as fundamental ontology which is also panpsychist emergentalist and is optimized for pragmatic utilitarism focused on mathemazited collective psychological valence optimalization and longtermist survival and progressive flourishing.

===Philosophy -> For science -> Hiearchy of sciences -> Description in all concepts that is nonlinear, topdown===

Sociology is collective psychology. Psychology studies dynamics of biological conscious physical systems on mostly nontechnical functional level. Consciousness studies study dynamics of conscious physical systems on all levels, functional and physical, using nontechnical and technical, mathematical or nonmathematical language. Biology is selective chemistry. Chemistry is applied physics. Physics is math constrained by reality. Mathematics is a type of symbolic language that is constrained by rules and consistency. Logic studies potential consistent rules. Philosophy is thinking about thinking, systematizing the systematized, exploring arbitrary symbolic languages with arbitrary questions about for example truth, ethics and nature of reality. Language is a communication protocol studied by linguistics and is an emergent property from biology or systems in general. Systems science, mathematical physics and statistics is one possible language for all science fields,  including studying the whole universe or humanity as a whole in relation to everything else.

===Philosophy -> Unity -> Description in all concepts that is nonlinear===

I love to juggle different ontologies depending on what is currently pragmatically useful. Not being commited to any particular ontology feels extremely free and full of relief. In explorative analytical mode I am not loyal to any particular set of I love to explore what kinds of assumptions can exist and what are their advantages and disadvantages in as neutral way as possible. In explorative experiental mode I love to explore what its like to deeply experience different ways of being, such as being one with everything on open individualism or nonexistence on empty individualism or increased sense of agency and unlimited possibilities of statespace of consciousness in idealism because of less attachment to the "physical being". Being agnostic because of difficulty or impossibility of empirical testability can free oneself from not optimal lenses. Being sceptic can find out disadvantages efficiently. Seeing reality as fundamentally mysterious and nongraspable by any concepts generates tons of awe and generates openminedness and epistemic humility meaning one has no total certainity about truthness and accuracy and fundamentalism of his models by dereifying concrete beliefs. We are all one because we're all locally embedded in the global universal wave function but we are also it through fundamental interconnectedness, relationality, nonseparability of everything, no system can ever be fully isolated. We're all also slices in spacetime or nothing at all because nothing is ever permanent. We're all also observing and acting systems that are segments that come into existence and dissolve into entropy because that's pragmatic notion to navigate everyday world and to engineer neurotechnologies and do other science. Fundamental optimistic assumption that things will get better both tries to predict the future but also forms it because collection of agents with doom assumption will have lesser motivation to change the world for better and thus decreasing the chances of it by that belief existing!

Describing dynamics of average sized objects in average speed with average size.

Classical mechanics is a physical theory describing the motion of macroscopic objects, from apples falling down to projectiles to parts of machinery and astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars, and galaxies. The earliest formulation of classical mechanics is often referred to as Newtonian mechanics with its equations of motion.

==Science -> Physics -> Classical -> Classical mechanics -> Intuitive description==

Objects are point particles, objects with negligible size. 
The motion of a point particle is determined by a small number of parameters: its position, mass, and the forces applied to it.
In reality, the kind of objects that classical mechanics can describe always have a non-zero size. (The behavior of very small particles, such as the electron, is more accurately described by quantum mechanics.) Objects with non-zero size have more complicated behavior than hypothetical point particles, because of the additional degrees of freedom, e.g., a baseball can spin while it is moving. However, the results for point particles can be used to study such objects by treating them as composite objects, made of a large number of collectively acting point particles. The center of mass of a composite object behaves like a point particle. Classical mechanics assumes that matter and energy have definite, knowable attributes such as location in space and speed. Non-relativistic mechanics also assumes that forces act instantaneously.

==Science -> Physics -> Classical -> Classical mechanics -> Mathematical description==

We can choose set theoretical or categorical foundations.

We can define set theory categorically as the category Set that follows category theoretic axioms. [Category theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) [Category of sets - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_sets)

Position of a particle in classical mechanics is a vector from the origin as a function of absolute time (any given pair of events is the same for all observers) in euclidian geometry.
There may be arbitrary number of particles.

particlePosition(time)=(right,up,left)
r(t)=(x,y,z)

Velocity, rate of change of displacement with time, is derivative of the position with respect to time.

particleVelocity(time)=rateOfChange(particleVelocity(time))
v=dr/dt

Velocity is a vector with length (speed) and direction (when reduced to a unit vector)
Velocity = Speed*DirectionUnitVector
u=dt

In the context of two moving objects, velocity of the first object 
velocityOfTheFistObjectFromPointOfViewOfTheSecondObject=VelocityMagnitudeOfTheFirstObject*FirstObjectDirection - VelocityMagnitudeOfTheSecondObject*SecondObjectDirection

Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, entropy, and the physical properties of matter and radiation. There is second law of thermodynamics, saying that any closed system will go towards entropy. It connects entropy with information.

- It's currently the most empirically tested theory of all of physics.

- It's a paradigm of a quantum field theory.

- It describes three of the four known fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions ‚Äì excluding gravity) in the universe and classifying all known elementary particles.

- It does not fully explain baryon asymmetry, incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity, or account for the universe's accelerating expansion as possibly described by dark energy. The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology. It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their non-zero masses.

==Science -> Physics -> Unity -> Quantum darwinism==

This is my favorite interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Quantum Darwinism is a theory meant to explain the emergence of the classical world from the quantum world as due to a process of Darwinian natural selection induced by the environment interacting with the quantum system in the process of decoherence; where the many possible quantum states are selected against in favor of a stable pointer state. Pointer states are quantum states, sometimes of a measuring apparatus, if present, that are less perturbed by decoherence than other states, and are the quantum equivalents of the classical states of the system after decoherence has occurred through interaction with the environment.

The holographic principle is a property of string theories and a supposed property of quantum gravity that states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary to the region.

AdS/CFT correspondence is application of this, a conjectured relationship between two kinds of physical theories. On one side are anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) which are used in theories of quantum gravity, formulated in terms of string theory or M-theory. On the other side of the correspondence are conformal field theories (CFT) which are quantum field theories, including theories similar to the Yang‚ÄìMills theories that describe elementary particles.

You can perform long, expensive quantum mechanical simulations to reproduce chemical processes. It's a lengthy process to simulate just a few picoseconds of a dozen atoms interacting, and the difficulty scales exponentially with the number of particles (a little bit less with good approximations, but the point stands). It's all theoretically possible, but for 99% of chemistry its still not practical to simulace chemistry just using fundamental physics. Quantum computers are more and more helping in simulating quantum systems! 

These tools allow us to study physical systems froms a more zoomed out bird eye abstracted view to reduce the giant complexity of the underlying interacting particles for us to more easily grasp and simulate reality on higher scales.

==Science -> General math of emergence of higher scales and other fields from physics -> Effective Field Theory==

In physics, an effective field theory is a type of approximation, or effective theory, for an underlying physical theory, such as a quantum field theory or a statistical mechanics model. An effective field theory includes the appropriate degrees of freedom to describe physical phenomena occurring at a chosen length scale or energy scale, while ignoring substructure and degrees of freedom at shorter distances (or, equivalently, at higher energies).

==Science -> General math of emergence of higher scales and other fields from physics -> Renormalization Group==

As the scale varies, it is as if one is changing the magnifying power of a notional microscope viewing the system. In so-called renormalizable theories, the system at one scale will generally consist of self-similar copies of itself when viewed at a smaller scale, with different parameters describing the components of the system. The components, or fundamental variables, may relate to atoms, elementary particles, atomic spins, etc. The parameters of the theory typically describe the interactions of the components.

==Science -> General math of emergence of higher scales and other fields from physics -> Pointcare Map==

In mathematics, particularly in dynamical systems, a first recurrence map or Poincar√© map, named after Henri Poincar√©, is the intersection of a periodic orbit in the state space of a continuous dynamical system with a certain lower-dimensional subspace, called the Poincar√© section, transversal to the flow of the system. More precisely, one considers a periodic orbit with initial conditions within a section of the space, which leaves that section afterwards, and observes the point at which this orbit first returns to the section. One then creates a map to send the first point to the second, hence the name first recurrence map.

==Science -> Philosophical interpretations of physics and other maths -> Superdeterminism==

Superdeterminism describes the set of local hidden-variable theories consistent with the results of experiments derived from Bell's theorem which include a local correlation between the measurement settings and the state being measured. Superdeterministic theories are not interpretations of quantum mechanics, but deeper theories which reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics on average, for which a few toy models have been proposed. In such theories, "the probabilities of quantum theory then become no more mysterious than those used in classical statistical mechanics."

==Science -> Philosophical interpretations of physics and other maths -> QBism==

In physics and the philosophy of physics, quantum Bayesianism is a collection of related approaches to the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the most prominent of which is QBism (pronounced "cubism"). QBism is an interpretation that takes an agent's actions and experiences as the central concerns of the theory. QBism deals with common questions in the interpretation of quantum theory about the nature of wavefunction superposition, quantum measurement, and entanglement.[1][2] According to QBism, many, but not all, aspects of the quantum formalism are subjective in nature. For example, in this interpretation, a quantum state is not an element of reality‚Äîinstead it represents the degrees of belief an agent has about the possible outcomes of measurements. Participatory realism: reality consists of more than can be captured by any putative third-person account of it.

As I said, you can perform long, expensive quantum mechanical simulations to reproduce chemical processes. It's a lengthy process to simulate just a few picoseconds of a dozen atoms interacting, and the difficulty scales exponentially with the number of particles (a little bit less with good approximations, but the point stands). It's all theoretically possible, but for 99% of chemistry its still not practical to simulace chemistry just using fundamental physics. Quantum computers are more and more helping in simulating quantum systems!

==Science -> Consciousness==

Biology is selective chemistry. Psychology studies dynamics of conscious physical systems on mostly nontechnical functional level. Consciousness studies study dynamics of conscious physical systems on all levels, functional and physical, using nontechnical and technical, mathematical or nonmathematical language. 

I'm gonna mainly focus on neurophenomenology, which is a branch of consciousness studies that tries to find the connection between the brain state and the state of experience, find correspondence between those two statespaces, establishing link between the subjective and objective measurments. Easiest example is finding the neural correlate of wellbeing.

All models of consciousness are right, they're just studying the same physical system (nervous system) from different angles using different tools from mathematics at different scales of abstraction with different degrees of predictive power of empirical data in their niches. Let's synthetize them and express them in the language of physics!

Different models of consciousness approximate different causal relationships, structure, properties, functions of conscious systems. They have different advantages and disadvantages!

Is consciousness reducible, approximately reducible, or irreducible? Does it even exist? No model will be a total understanding, since no consciousness and physics models are explaining everything and totally predictive. Really is so complex!

It's also working under physicalism, what if panpsychism is the case, or some kind of dualism or different kind of monism? We can never know. Maybe those questions dont make sense at all. Maybe reality in this domain is ieffable!

Let's test under physicalism and empiricism? Some parts of the brain break down under anestesia or other unconsciousness, or do we need global breakdown of functional massage passing like in cessations under predictive coding?

This still assumes nonconsious systems existing. Or that the other system suddenly didnt become conscious as we unified with it. What if nonconscious systems don't make sense from panpsychist perspective? Why is all physics by default not conscious? Can we trust our phenomenology, how linked is it mathematically to brain dynamics, or conscious physics in general? What if solipcism is actually true? Do these questions even make sense objectively, or is it all subjective philosophical play and possible confusion? We don't know! What if predictivity of models is really the only truth we can trust and everything else is arbitrary? We have to do so much testing!

I like all approaches, but we know so little. What if really we need multiple of those mathametical conditions to be met for a system to posses consciousness? I don't know where to put my bayesin certainity to at all. The causal factors seem to be all over the place, from proposed theories to measurement attempts. Some tell us great stuff about how we process information. Some tell us stuff about biology. Some tell us stuff about underlying physics, classical, statistical, relativistic, quantum, some kind of unity... What if its really simple as just one brain region, lol. What if its so complex that we need to solve quantum gravity first, hah. What if both? What if we're doing something that's totally disconnected from reality, or all approaches make certain sense at the same time and we just need to unify big chunk of them? Why do we even ask this?

Cognitive science knows we don‚Äôt construct experience as it actually is, but some apprimate representation of it, (indirect realism) we construct an internal world simulation, a generative model with all our beliefs. [[Predictive coding - Wikipedia]([Predictive coding - Wikipedia]([Predictive coding - Wikipedia]([Predictive coding - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding)))) Predictive coding - Wikipedia] Visual illusions show this the best. All of it can be analyzed using all sorts of methapors, intution or mathematics from physics and beyond. (neurophenomenology)

Matrix is pretty close. Best methaphor is that we live inside a videogame engine that the brain tells itself that helps us survive. And we can do some many things with this simulation!

Let‚Äôs deconstruct experience.

[[File:WorldSketch.png|500px|Alt text]]

What is your experience right now? That depends on lots of factors. Do you feel a stable sense of identity at all times? Do you tend to hyperfocus on a task so hard that you literally become the thing you‚Äôre focusing on? Most people feel like they‚Äôre some identity (their thoughts, conditionings, some source) behind their eyes,. This ‚Äúme‚Äù source uses arrow of attention to pay attention to all sorts of objects ‚Äì cats, this text, even thoughts. This ‚Äúme‚Äù is the center in our experience, our actions happen from it from the inside to the outside, environmental factors and other forces happens to it from the outside. The ‚Äúme‚Äù self model and ‚Äúmy thoughts‚Äù can be labelled as physical or beyond physics in some spiritual realm. (dualism vs monism) This me (physical part of it) lives inside some home, on top of some earth, in some universe with euclidian space with linear continuous time, in multiverses and so on. This universe is made of intuitiove ideas, less technical (things just happening and moving by their will or without their will) or more technical (classical mechanics of all sorts of things) or different ideas we have about physics (particles, fields, algorithms, information, strings,..), or out of consciousness, or combination, or something else, depending on how much you think about these topics in which direction. (physicalism vs idealism) And we assume we exist, or that there is in general some kind of existence.

All of this can be played with. Normally you sit and see things around you, the beauty of nature and complexities of our social system. They‚Äôre things in your field of consciousness that move around and transform. We can make intutitive models trying to predict them, or use physics for it. 

As long as any mathematics used to model conscious experience resonate with someone‚Äôs experience, or can be simulated, or are connected or directly the models used in neuroscience from classical architectures to machinery from quantum field theory, they‚Äôre technically empirically valid. It becomes objective when big chunk of people resonate with the mathematics or/and when its directly empirically observed in the brain dynamics.  The goal of neurophenomenology is to connect the mathematics of experience with the mathematics of the brain dynamics. 

Let‚Äôs build experience bottom up on top of assumptions, which can be dereified, transformed, dissolved, strenghtened, as they can be seen as bayesian priors in our cortical hiearchy, [[The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg3cQXf4zSE))))))))))))))))) The Bayesian Brain and Meditation] [[OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF](https://psyarxiv.com/zqh4b/)))))))))))))))))))) On the Varieties of Conscious Experiences: Altered Beliefs Under Psychedelics (ALBUS)]  how can that be achieved I will write later. Let‚Äôs use the simplest language possible.

Something exists. Some structure exists. Empty set. Let‚Äôs call it 

Existence = ()

This existence can be empty, which represents nothingness, or potentiality for anything, superposition of all possibilities.
To fill this existence with something concrete, lets give it 3D space with contents that evolve in space and time.

Existence = (Space*3(Contents), Time)

Time can be a discrete or continuous number representing linear time. Space can have euclidian geometry, or hyperbolic geometry on DMT. We can use classical mechanics or choose to use more advanced math. In some math, space and time are inherently interlinked. In other math, spacetime doesn‚Äôt need to be fundamental at all.
Contents are now an empty set, let‚Äôs fill them according to the top picture.

Contents = Universe(Earth(Humanity(Self‚Äôs house(Self, Cat, Center = Self‚Äôs behind eyes, Attention(Center, Cat))))))

This is very simplified notion of encoding that inside universe (which can be some intuitive thing, physicalist notion, or field of consciousness) there is earth and on it humanity that includes self‚Äôs house which includes self, cat, center of experience located behind self‚Äôs eyes, and attention arrow currently looking from the center to the cat.

Each thing can have many mathematical definitions, for example it can be modelleted as an arbitrary geometrical shape that satisfies certain properties (what our brain‚Äôs neural classifiers learned to pattern match as things in our experience), or a markov blanket. 

Most of these things are running in the subconscious for most people as most people don‚Äôt pay attention to modelling themselves inside a universe and just model themselves in their neighbour with no big models, such as for example:

Contents = MyCountry(MyHouse(Me),BobsHouse(Bob), Friend(Me,Bob))

This person would be aware of spacetime with him in his house and bob in his house and their friendship relation.

We can model decomposing all things into parts and atoms, or see things as wholes. Some functions of some systems cant be seen that much without considering the whole. 

In terms of meditation, we can start with:  

Contents = Universe(Earth(Humanity(Self‚Äôs house(Self, Center = Self‚Äôs behind eyes, Attention(Center, Self‚Äôs breath))))))

And then we can start decomposing it. There might be much more processes happening in our mind. We can locate thoughts and feelings, and start paying attention to that. We can do mathematical analysis on top of them, noticing their shape using geometry and topology, or how they‚Äôre made of just vibrations. This can be modelled in classical field theory, hamonic analysis. We can look at their information using information theory. We can deconstruct everything if we want, or just analyze, or energize what we want, create arbitrary mind constructs, identities, world, whatever. We can create healing deities radiating love to all beings. We can make spacetime radiate nourishment, love and kindness to all living beings and objects. Love and dissolution increases information flow, induces relief, increases symmetries and consonance.

Attention can have many shapes. Attention might be seen as arbitrary topological shape like any other in our experience, but acting as thermodynamic information flow bridge from point A to B. When we deconstruct center, cender suddenly becomes nowhehre and everywhere and it tends to break attention. Me in humanity in earth in universe is a hiearchy that can be temporarily dissolved. We can dissolve all vibrating clusters of sensations that are particles forming ecosystems and interacting subagents with various math properties. We can end up with just the experience of centerless infinite vast still quiet space. That can be deconstructed into nothingness, and even beyond existence. Formless state tends to be neither perception nor not perception (Jhanas) or neither existence nor not existence, where linguistic conceptualizing cognitive faculties and memory breaks down, void, structurelessness.

==Science -> Consciousness -> Concrete phenomena -> Annealing==

===Science -> Consciousness -> Concrete phenomena -> Annealing -> Layman description===

Neural Annealing can be understood in terms of this analogy: 
Brain is like a metal. When it gets used in activities that take effort, you start to feel tearing and inconsistencies in your experience, less symmetries in the metal's (brain's) structure (tissue and activity). The smoother the metal is, the more pleasant it feels. (Symmetry Theory of Valence) Activities that energize you (in the sense that they make you less tired), that don't work with concrete thoughts (meditation, psychedelics, music, excercise, cold showers, breath work, strong emotions,...) heat up this metal, that starts to melt and fill up the tears and reconfigure the metal into a more symmetrical shape, which then cools down (integration) and you feel more peaceful, calm, relaxed, energized, smooth, happy, in flow, effortless, blissful, joyous, loving, connected, holistic, complete, fullfilled, in the moment,...

The process of dissolving local structures and unifying is achieved by annealing. Here‚Äôs a simplified example, suppose the shape on the left is a shape corresponding to brain‚Äôs world model‚Äôs topology before, then it gets injected with a lot of energy (neural activity) through energizing meditations of psychedelics, which results in different parts of the brain synchronizing and things happening out of their own boundaries as the activity is overflowing from everything to everything. The resulting topology of the neural networks after this process gets smoothened out, more interconnected, more holistic! Injecting the field of consciousness with energy, leading to disintegrations and fusion of local before divided ecosystems of particles resulting in a topology with more efficient information propagation and less contracted energies generating stress!

Synthetizing what lots of functioning trauma healing strategies have in common leads to something like:

1) establishing safe trustable context, respecting and potentially slowly expanding window of tolerance - creating more safe, trustable, loving, caring, confident, connecting, accepting, grounded (Polyvagal Therapy), relaxed, calm, powerful, forgiving, hopeful, playful (Play Theraphy) context - getting out of traumatic environment (family, work, community,...), establishing trust with healer, psychotherapist, group (Group Therapy & Peer Support Groups) or creating trustable internal memories/parts/subagents/priorities/processes - for dialog between them in Internal Family Systems), or trusting the source or background of experience (Comprehensive Resource Model)

2) in this context enabling and opening traumatic memories/parts/subagents/priorities/processes though enabling the correct related associations (Prolonged Exposure Theraphy, Brief Eclectic Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, Inner Child Work, EMDR) and putting words, feelings, imagery to it, conceptualizing it, exploring the repressed parts (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), getting access to the whole chunk of the traumatized part of the brain, or the body where trauma might be in interrelated way be stored as well as tension (Somatic Therapy), where massage or breathwork or can help as well to relax

3) in this open window for change, reframing through reliving those memories in this better context (Coherence Theraphy, Cognitive Processing Therapy), building a new connected self with less dissociation, balancing between change and acceptance (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), and potentially learning healthy coping strategies with any distress (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)

4) integrating into a more healthy environment with above properties, preventing further harm by learning healthy boundaries (respecting one's needs and also needs of others to certain extend) (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) and knowing environments with potential redflags that have potential for retraumatizing

Various belief weakening substances like psychedelics, entactogens, dissociatives can help in belief transformation by weakening those sticky structures in the nervous system, or downers in relaxing, or betablockers in memory reconsolodation, or stimulants in focusing on the memories and so on.

You can dissolve by:

Paying the least amount of effort to the breath and nothing else. If mind starts doing anything else, come back to breath, without getting angry or forcing it in relaxed way

Looking for the sense of looker and center

Noticing the sense of background vastness, stillness, silence

Seeing all local structures (mental and muscle contractions) as not needed for safety (ideas about the self and the world, defence mechanisms, what comes up when you think about death which doesn‚Äôt want to be dropped and let go off) and getting into empty space with no resistance

Looking for sense of spacetime and deconstructing it

Noticing how everything is made of nothingness

Deconstructing even nothingness itself

By having all safety put into in deepest just existence prior
‚ÄúAbiding‚Äù ‚Äúin‚Äù neither perception nor not perception, neither existence nor not existence

I suspect there is a genetic parameter, modulated by environmental factors or overall experiences, that sets your baseline rigidity of structures in your nervous system, giving rise to loose mind, and i sense my starting point baseline was more on the fluditity side in this axies already both genetically and environmentally (when i look at my family and through what kinds of experiences ive been though), for an avarage person it is pretty hard, but the more one meditates, the easier it gets - i suspect this distribution of baseline states and of how well one learns these skills lay on the logarithmic scale/gaussian.

What meditation trains is the ability to turn it on and off whenever you want, or edit it more easily, leading to experiences with much less suffering, getting more flexibility, more flow state, more ability for deep rest.

Its cultivating the agency over how your sense of self and overall world simulation is constructed.

Though increased overall fluidity can have its disadvantages as well, such as being in a rigid model for a longer amount of time might be less stable.

Is structurelessness death at peak 5-MeO-DMT state or Jhanas are mathematically equivalent to the heat death of the universe?

After psychologically dying so many times on meditation‚Äôs cessations and 5-MeO-DMT  psychedelic, a sense of one continuous linear identity/experience/self doesn't make sense anymore, there is lack of globally connected continuity after death ripped a hole into the linear flow of phenomenal time.

Everytime i think of peak 5-MeO-DMT experience, my mind stops on complete awe in what the god is even possible to experience, the literal sense of infinitely big totally energized field of consciousness full of sacred meaning before transcending beyond spacetime and into total structurelessness. It shows me how much we know nothing, how everything we think is so fragile, so we can pick the mental tools that are the most useful to us in our everyday life without getting stuck in unhelpful stuff we feel as totally real. It helps me dissolve on meditation more easily as well as """i""" dont fear psychological death that much anymore. In direct experience i can experience much more easily the sense of how all of our language and modelling is relational and not individualistic, """I""" wouldn't exist withot everything else in our shared colective linguistic/overall hallucinated universe (selfworld model with all its sense gates), instead of our individual parts of it. There was no "me" or "meeting". Structurelessness is the closest word I have for it. It feels beyond language and concepts but includes them all. Since it feels like it includes all experience, our everyday experience made of it in a sense. It feels like the most general allencompassing (not only mathematical) structure possible. But also not, hah, escapes all classical logic. All paradoxes in classical logic are nonclassicaly true. It's approximately like "normal experience" is this infinitely small blib in this enormous possible infinitely giant statespace of consciousness. 

All of this so much dereifies the self, makes it much more flexible, fluid, """you""" gain agency over the sense of """you""", more easily deconstruct and reconstruct it however you wish. I still get sometimes stuck in some addictive stimuli, such as social media, or underestimate how various environmental influences can have lots of effects over my state of mind that are hard to handle in combination with my hypersensitivity to everything, on which i still work a lot, but in comparision to before, its much better. The power of flexible more aware mind adds a lot, but its a never ending path in a sense, as its still strengtening the mind's neural central executive network's etc. muscles.

Many statistics about the world are looking bright! [[Is the world getting better or worse? A look at the numbers | Steven Pinker - YouTube]([Is the world getting better or worse? A look at the numbers | Steven Pinker - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCm9Ng0bbEQ)) Is the world getting better or worse? A look at the numbers | Steven Pinker - YouTube] Poverty is going down for example. We have better than ever healthcare technology. But at what costs? let's look at all the numbers.

In this chapter we delve into what is the current state of the world and its future. What crises people propose and what does the data imply? what are possible futures? What existencial risks are more and more probable? What are the solutions to mitigating, preventing bad things from happening? How to solve causes and symptoms of the world's biggest problems? What to do if things already go bad? When trying to enact solutions, how to take in account that many people are trying many different things? 

These risks and what they're affecting don't exist in isolation. For example AI is affecting lots of things in our system, such as education and culture. And for example, there are people trying to both pause AI and accelerate AI, which results in both attempts happening in different parts of our system and interacting with eachother. Multiple things need to happen together, for example AI doesn't exist in isolation, solutions should synergize together, maximizing their advantages, minimizing their disadvantages!

We should also remember that predicting future is hard, because humanity is a chaotic system sensitive to intial conditions and we have finite computational power to grasp the complexity of the world, that might be irreducible on such a scale.

==Science -> Social systems -> Concrete phenomena -> Current state of our world and its future -> Multipolar traps aka moloch==

I'm gonna start with explaining one simple concept from game theory that's gonna show up everywhere as we discuss various crises and risks.

Multipolar traps aka Moloch is a risk that is under lots of other risks driving lots of crises.

Moloch is the personification of the forces that coerce competing individuals to take actions which, although locally optimal, ultimately lead to situations where everyone is worse off. Moreover, no individual is able to unilaterally break out of the dynamic. The situation is a bad Nash equilibrium. A trap. 

One example of a multipolar trap, a Molochian dynamic, is a Red Queen race between scientists who must continually spend more time writing grant applications just to keep up with their peers doing the same. Through unavoidable competition, they have all lost time while not ending up with any more grant money. And any scientist who unilaterally tried to not engage in the competition would soon be replaced by one who still does. If they all promised to cap their grant writing time, everyone would face an incentive to defect. [https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/moloch Moloch definition of LessWrong]

More examples are the Prisoner's Dilemma, dollar auctions, overfishing, Malthusian trap, capitalism, two-income trap, agriculture, arms races (technology, nuclear weapons), races to the bottom, education system, science, and government corruption and corporate welfare.

Simple, right? Stop producing CO2. But this isn't as easy. Companies have to do it out of their will and agree together. it would be benefitial for everyone if everyone stopped causing climate change, but its not happening because of competition on the market. If my rival won't stop, i won't as well, if I don't wanna economically loose. This is a special case of above mentioned multipolar trap. For example social/moral pressure or regulations have to direct them instead, since emegent bottomup global coordination doesnt work.

Economical crisis is a spectrum and some countries do better than others. Covid has damaged lots of economies. Sri landa collapsed recently. People's savings go to trash, making people poor. 

==Science -> Social systems -> Concrete phenomena -> Current state of our world and its future -> Economical crisis -> Unsustainability==

Some people argue our economic system is fundamentally unsustainable, because its built on exponentially growing GDP (and critique GDP being a good measure of progress) and thus exponentially extracting resources that replenish linearly or never. Finding new resources can help. Technology can help build better more susianable resources or digitalize economy, but it all still runs on finite physical processes. When we look at why past cities collapsed, one of the common reasons is unsustainability trap.

As tensions increase, nuclear war gets more probable.

The current economic system was a solution to no wars happening after WW2, where growth was not mediated by war but by exponentially growing GDP of economies, which might be breaking now with exponential extraction of resources that replenish linearly and Russia is under such pressure which results in it attacking Ukraine. If we assume all nations want to fundamentally expontentially grow by GDP, technology, resources and other means, and if physically nonviolent ways of growing are not an option anymore, they use war to conquer and grow, is this Russia's current state? Would financially helping them instead of sanctions paradoxically help the war other than accelerate? Or would it accelerate as their tense hatred of EU/USA etc. and need for annihilation could be used realized more efficiently? Or are sanctions strong enough to kill all their power to conquer? Maybe there's some middle way to minimize the growth tension that leads to the war? Should Russia be disintegrated to end it's evolutionary pressures for war?

It's a natural force in our system. Competition can make more decentralized unregulated progress faster, but too much of competition and individualization and lack of global cooperation leads to problems like companies causing climate change because they would loose in the economical system, so what seems to only work is to regulate them by carbon tax (but even there corruption or lack of empirical reasoning can make mess), or make clean technologies more economically benefitial by rewarding their use or investing in their advancement. People racing in developing advanced AI to be first on the market without doing sufficient AI safety research is another example of molochian dynamics.

"Game B" is a conceptual framework that contrasts with "Game A". The terms have been discussed by various thought leaders and communities, primarily in the realm of systems thinking, societal evolution, and complexity. The concepts can be broken down as follows:

1. Game A:

- Represents the current dominant socio-economic and political systems in which most of the world operates.

- Characterized by competition, short-term thinking, hierarchical structures, and often unsustainable practices.

- May lead to existential risks, environmental degradation, and societal inequality.

2. Game B:

- A proposed new way of structuring society, economics, and politics.

- Emphasizes cooperation over competition, long-term sustainability, decentralized and distributed systems, and resilience.

- Aims to reduce existential risks and create a more harmonious, sustainable, and equitable world.

The transition from Game A to Game B is not about replacing one "game" with another in a simple, linear fashion. Instead, it's about evolving our collective thinking and systems to address the complex challenges we face in the 21st century.

Communities and thinkers discussing Game B often focus on topics like:

- New economic models that prioritize well-being and sustainability.

- Decentralized decision-making and governance structures.

- The role of technology in facilitating cooperative systems.

- Personal development and consciousness as foundational to societal change.

The concepts of Game A and Game B are abstract and can be interpreted in various ways. They serve as a starting point for discussions about how to transition from our current systems to more sustainable and equitable ones.

Goal of Game B is stable liberal democracy by educated  on regenerative economy by degrowth or weakened sustainable growth disincentivizing overly competing selfcentered sociopathic agents.

Goal of the more extreme cases of Effective Accelerationism is supergrowth with transhumanist transcendental longtermist utopia of AIs as a next step in evolution, replacing humans with AI.

==Science -> Social systems -> Concrete phenomena -> Current state of our world and its future -> Bottom up culture of connection -> Unifying languages and visions -> Shared good future utopian or protopian vision -> AGI as better replacement of us aka Effective accelerationism -> My thoughts==

I like the fact how this movement is pointing at the danger of regulatory capture, though its not really looking at how else to globally mitigate possible AI existencial risks, other than pointing at the fact that opensourcing AIs leads to better decentralized collective safety research, and also faster overall decentralized AI progress, which is true, but it also gives incompetent or bad actors more power to do destruction.

But i suspect in practice ultimately accelerating AI would just selfdestruct us even faster without any AIs after unless exponential growth of AIs getting better is truly so big that instead of AIs fighting and killing everything it will be suddenly one AGI absorbing everything extremely fast that nothing else can grasp it. I also think there is nonzero probability that we won't selfdestruct ourselves - more on that later. I think in practice we should really think about risks but also about not slowing down progress totally. Middle way! And we can still do as much as we can to prevent molochian dynamics by strenghtening cooperation as much as possible to prevent global catastrophic failure modes, but I understand why some people lost hope in that and see AGI A≈° the only way to preserve interesting things (intelligence) happening in the universe. But having lost hope means it decreases those chances of hope selfrealizing itself in the real world even more, as that not only predicts Future but also forms those beliefs also form our collective actions! It also things this is objective physics of how things have to turn out with 100% certainity, and as a bayesian that gives nothing 100% probability, I'm not buying that really. Predicting reality of such big systems as humanity is almost almost impossible as uncertainity grows and chaotic nature of systems having totally different results in evolution from slight nudge in initial conditions like in weather, as humanity can be to certain degree seen as one giant weather system with slight mathematical correpondences from dynamical systems theory or systems science in general.

After we get into a supercooperation clusters, sentient beings (possibly beyond humans) are free to choose to wirehead themselves into pure hedonium (5-MeO-DMT like state), or endless novelty (DMT like state). No more darwinian restructions on how suffering and other limits are implemented.

Let's integrate it all into one framework!

==Science -> Social systems -> Concrete phenomena -> Current state of our world and its future -> Keeping good mental health while solving world problems==

By looking into what should be fixed in the world for the benefit of all beings, we can run into hopelessness that things are unchangable. Always have a deep assumption that things instead are changeable! We also tend to install subagents inside our cortical hiearchy that might be overwhelming - You can counter that using other subagents, like deities of compassion that infinitely help all beings! Sometimes if mind goes haywire with all thoughts everywhere, you can use resting and deconstrucitve meditations ot rest in a void, in a hybernation state, for a bit, to recharge, to not burn out. Make sure to also do human things like socializing and caring for your health like going outside, excercising, eating good and so on, and not grinding all day!

==Science -> Other==

==Unity==

==Unity -> Hiearchy of knowledge and sciences==

===Unity -> Hiearchy of sciences -> Description only in introduced language and concepts that is nonlinear, bottomup===

Sociology is collective psychology. Psychology studies dynamics of biological conscious physical systems on mostly nontechnical functional level. Consciousness studies study dynamics of conscious physical systems on all levels, functional and physical, using nontechnical and technical, mathematical or nonmathematical language. Biology is selective chemistry. Chemistry is applied physics. Physics is math constrained by reality. Mathematics is a type of symbolic language that is constrained by rules and consistency. Logic studies potential consistent rules. Philosophy is thinking about thinking, systematizing the systematized, exploring arbitrary symbolic languages with arbitrary questions about for example truth, ethics and nature of reality. Language is a communication protocol studied by linguistics and is an emergent property from biology or systems in general. Systems science, mathematical physics and statistics is one possible language for all science fields,  including studying the whole universe or humanity as a whole in relation to everything else. 

All of the above framed in physicalist information theoretic computational language

==Total freedom, potentiality for any symbolic or nonsymbolic structure==

Our minds are free to think anything about reality! In the beggining before thinking about anything, there is just full potential, where anything can become true. Let's explore various ways of looking at the world in divfferent stories we tell ourselves.

==Exploration of possible philosophical assumptions==

===Nature of reality===

What is the nature of reality? Do both physics and minds exist in a connected way and they are not inside eachother? (Dualism) Or are they inside eachother/one emerging from the other? (Monism) Is consciousness fundamental? (Idealism) Is physics fundamental? (Physicalism) Is something third fundamental? (Neutral monism) Is this a question that doesn't make sense and doesn't fundamentally touch any "deeper reality" and its just mental model play? (Mysterianism) Is the dichotomy between physics and consciousness not a thing and they're one thing, is all physics conscious? (Panpsychist physicalism) Are those physical systems with some mathematical property the only individual conscious ones? (Nonpanpsychist physicalism) How is boundary of conscious physical systems determined mathematically? Do conscious systems see reality as it is or just some abstract approximated representation of it? (Direct vs indirect realism)  [Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality - YouTube]([Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality - YouTube]([Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality - YouTube]([Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality - YouTube]([Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality - YouTube]([Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw5Q5h8s6FI)))))) Is quantum physics, quantum field theory or other fundamental physics theory fundamental? (Physicalist reductionism) Are all emergent scales in science also as real, such as classical physics, biology, chemistry, sociology? (Emergence paradigm) [Emergentism: A Philosophy of Complexity and Meaning with Brendan Graham Dempsey - YouTube]([Emergentism: A Philosophy of Complexity and Meaning with Brendan Graham Dempsey - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfRFOJWZ5j0)) Is information fundamental? (quantum information theory) [Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023](https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/fields-physics-2023))))))))))))))))))

===Identity===

What is our identity? Are we a segment? (Closed individualism) Are we a physical system that starts existing when it is born and stops existing when it dies, when it dissolves? (Secular) Is there a soul that is minduploaded to heaven? (Christianity, Islam) Are we in a cycle or reincarnation? (Hinduism) Are we a spacetime-slice or a moment of experience? (Empty individualism) Are we everyone? (Open individualism)

===Epistemology===

What is the nature of knowledge and truth? Does knowledge come primarly from direct sensory experience? (Empiricism) (Enactivism) From intellect? (Rationalism) Build by experiences and reflections on them? (Constructivism) Is a proposition true according to how much practical consequences it has? (Pragmatism) Is there inherent uncertainity to the possibility of having certain knowledge? (Skepticism) Is knowledge built upon a foundation of basic self-evident truths or experiences? (Foundationalism) Are beliefs justified if they cohere or fit well with other beliefs within a system? (Coherentism) Is truth and knowledge not absolute and varies depending on culture, society, or individual perspectives? (Relativism) Does the strength of a signal determine how true it feels? Are our mental model useful data compressing approximations of our internal and external dynamics, informed by natural sciences and their empirical methods? (Naturalized epistemology) https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/803428963435282452/1137803898552328314/image.png?width=787&height=600 https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/992213422274003066/1116711387394228224/20230609_145134.jpg?width=800&height=600

===Ethics===

What actions are right or wrong? If it leads to the most overall happiness or pleasure or generally gain in value? (Consequentialism, Utilitarianism) If they satisfy objective rules or duties that we must obey regardless of outcomes? (Deontology) Cultivating good character traits and virtues? (Virtue ethics) Is it determined by individual and cultural beliefs? (Relativism)

==Most useful philosophical assumptions==

I love to juggle different ontologies depending on what is currently pragmatically useful. Not being commited to any particular ontology feels extremely free and full of relief. In explorative analytical mode I am not loyal to any particular set of I love to explore what kinds of assumptions can exist and what are their advantages and disadvantages in as neutral way as possible. In explorative experiental mode I love to explore what its like to deeply experience different ways of being, such as being one with everything on open individualism or nonexistence on empty individualism or increased sense of agency and unlimited possibilities of statespace of consciousness in idealism because of less attachment to the "physical being". Being agnostic because of difficulty or impossibility of empirical testability can free oneself from not optimal lenses. Being sceptic can find out disadvantages efficiently. Seeing reality as fundamentally mysterious and nongraspable by any concepts generates tons of awe and generates openminedness and epistemic humility meaning one has no total certainity about truthness and accuracy and fundamentalism of his models by dereifying concrete beliefs. We are all one because we're all locally embedded in the global universal wave function but we are also it through fundamental interconnectedness, relationality, nonseparability of everything, no system can ever be fully isolated. We're all also slices in spacetime or nothing at all because nothing is ever permanent. We're all also observing and acting systems that are segments that come into existence and dissolve into entropy because that's pragmatic notion to navigate everyday world and to engineer neurotechnologies and do other science. Fundamental optimistic assumption that things will get better both tries to predict the future but also forms it because collection of agents with doom assumption will have lesser motivation to change the world for better and thus decreasing the chances of it by that belief existing!

===Assumptions for science===

I'm gonna unpack this in the next section:

For science, I'm gonna asssume by empirical bayesianism constructed approximating model of reality in physicalist combination of quantum physics and quantum information theory as fundamental ontology which is also panpsychist emergentalist and is optimized for pragmatic utilitarism focused on mathemazited collective psychological valence optimalization and longtermist survival and progressive flourishing.

Empiricism assumes that truthness of a model is determined by its predictive and explanatory power guided by occam's razor. Baysianism assumes that this model is slowly determined by slow updating of its structure according to what evidence in empirical data are presented. Approximating means that all our models we assume are finding regularities in dynamics by useful approximations.

Raw concrete empirical measurements and predictive mathematical models build on top of them is the ultimate minimization of vagueness, filtering signal out of noise. Though measurement outcomes still depends on what tools we use to measure and what mathematical and philosophical assumptions we use to contextualize them in.

==Fundamental structure of reality for science==

I'm gonna unpack this in the next section:

Physicalism means that what fundamentally exists are models of physics and quantum mechanics with quantum darwinism framed inside quantum information theory is our best current approximation that is set as fundamental. Panpsychist means that any unified bound individual system with information processing is a conscious entity and structure of experience corresponds to structure of it's physical dynamics and information networks. Emergentism means that the fundamental quantum physics layer/scale exists as equally as more surface classical scales such as dynamics of atoms, molecules, cells, functional brain regions, animals, societies, planets, galaxies and so on, where each scale can be studied using (quantum) information theory. 

===Classical physics===

Let's start with classical physics to make sense of macroscopic phenomena, which means lets not look at the quantum behavior of microscopic fundamental particles. Newton's law of motion helps us predict the future trajectory of an object. Thermodynamics helps us predict how contracted heat aka energy has tendency to distribute itself into the surroundings according to the second law of thermodynamics where everything goes towards entropy aka eqilibrium. There are many types of classical differential equations that help us predict behaviors of lots of types of systems, such as how computers work, dynamics of neurons or different variables when analyzing society such as evolutionary economical models.

4th law of thermodynamics: organisms accelerate 2nd by converting negentropy into entropy by dissipation looking like they resist it.

===Information theory, Classical formulation of the free energy principle formalizing conscious agents===

Now let's talk about the free energy principle (FEP) that I'm gonna use as both epistemological framework (bayesianism) and to define physics of survival. [ActInf Livestream #045.0 ~ "The free energy principle made simpler but not too simple" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #045.0 ~ "The free energy principle made simpler but not too simple" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #045.0 ~ "The free energy principle made simpler but not too simple" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #045.0 ~ "The free energy principle made simpler but not too simple" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #045.0 ~ "The free energy principle made simpler but not too simple" - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MQQKaKEXs0))))) [Dr. MAXWELL RAMSTEAD - The Physics of Survival - YouTube]([Dr. MAXWELL RAMSTEAD - The Physics of Survival - YouTube]([Dr. MAXWELL RAMSTEAD - The Physics of Survival - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qb28P7ksyE))) [Karl Friston's Unfalsifiable Free Energy Principle - YouTube]([Karl Friston's Unfalsifiable Free Energy Principle - YouTube]([Karl Friston's Unfalsifiable Free Energy Principle - YouTube]([Karl Friston's Unfalsifiable Free Energy Principle - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ1fsXQz7M4)))) https://static.miraheze.org/qualiaresearchwiki/a/af/ActiveInference.png

FEP is mathematical "truth", epistemological framework, scalefree classical or quantum physics information theoretic ontology, modelling language, generator of process theories for any physical systems across scales (mainly brain and society), machine learning architecture, psychology model, what else? Different fields speaking different languages require different types of explanations, such as for threorists, engineers, information theory, classical physics, quantum physics, machine learning people, philosophers, mathematicians, neuroscientists, biologists, complex systemists, psychologists, sociologists, laymen.

Free energy principle starts with defining a thing. It asks what must a thing that survives do? It must be stable. How it does that? It looks like as if its resisting the 2nd law of thermodynamics where systems tend to go towards entropy, towards disintegrated equilibrium. A thing is an open system, which means that its not fully isolated, where energy is coming inside and out of it via various entrances. It uses this energy to stabilize its structure to resist decay. 4th law of thermodynamics states that biological systems accelerate 2nd law by being a stable negentropic structure that serves as a machine that converts environment's negentropy into entropy through dissipation.

For example us eating food which is basis for our biological machine. How do we systematically find food in our environment? We must be able to predict it and act on it. How do we do that? Our brain approximates bayesian mechanics. What is that? Bayes theorem tells us the optimal way of processing information that natural selection approximately recruited in us, where the probaility of our model of the causes of our perception (aka priors) given our measured input sensory data being true aka corresponding to how it is statistically in reality can be calculated by probability of our input sensory data given our predicted causes times probability of our predicted causes, all divided by the probability of our input sensory data. [The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg3cQXf4zSE))))))))))))))))) Issue is that when analytically calculating the last term we get combinatorial explosion, leading to it not being computable. Evolution sidesteps this issue by partially by evolution preprogrammed priors, such as subconsciously monitoring and influencing our blood pressure, or doing lots of partitioning of sensory data, such as dividing into different senses, doing distinctions between self and other, modelling our own ability to influence the world and so on, all of which is maintained in an always active generative model that acts as a software that looks at sensory data, compares it with our priors, and sends a prediction error if there is a mismatch, which creates evolutionary pressure to update our model of the world, such as for example changing our perspective on some issue when presented with different evidence (certain ways of thinking are stuck in rigid attractor where this mechanism of updating is malfunctioning) or for example when we see a pink unicorn dancing on a rainbow when on psychedelics we get confused and see it as outlier that probably isnt real according to our priors, but seeing lots of unicorns overtime might change our priors. Or we can act on the environment for out sensory data to meet our prior expectations. This whole process reduces our uncertainity about the world.

More generally and formally, a thing corresponds to a markov blanket, which is a graph of nodes that learn correlations from its surroundings where you can locate a statistical boundary, where depending on how this particle (an observer with a reference frame) is complex [Imgur: The magic of the Internet]([Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/xHvym29)) you can locate nodes that seem to encode hidden states, meaning correlations encoding the outside world's (outside blanket's) structure, nodes that look as if they're just measuring and compressing the outside nodes, and nodes that look as if they're acting on the environment by statistical causal influence (doesnt exist in inert particles), and it tends to be nested a hieachy of markov blankets composed of markov blankets and so on, where you get dynamics of message passing and circular causal influence of the agent with the environment. Even more formally on this markov blanket a principle of least action is applied that minimizes statistical quantity of variational free energy that helps the model to be as accurate as possible while being the least complex as possible. It can be seen through the lens of thermodynamics as energy contractions and flow on this topology of information networks. You can crave certain neural classifiers or certain paths and then interconnect them via higher order nonlinear neural connections. The probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge about a system is the one with largest information entropy aka avarage amount of information or uncertainity inherent to the variable's possible outcomes. (generalization of thermodynamic entropy) [Principle of maximum entropy - Wikipedia]([Principle of maximum entropy - Wikipedia]([Principle of maximum entropy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy))) All of those insights can be used for ideal rational epistemology!

===Quantum physics===

We've covered classical physics so far, now let's look at quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is a general framework that can be used to study evolution and dynamics of particles like in classical physics, but instead of objects and particles as deterministic points or shapes in classical 3D space, their classical information becomes inherently probabilistic and a concept of entanglement is introduced that says that any two systems that are entagled are inseparable. When we apply quantum mechanics to the fundamental particles level, particles are represented using complex valued wave function that evolves the probability distribution of the possible particle's classical properties. In quantum electrodynamics [Quantum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum)_electrodynamics or standard model or quantum field theory in general, particles are excitations of matter and interaction quantum fields that fill all of space.

===Unifying quantum with the classical, Quantum darwinism or other options===

Quantum darwinism [Quantum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum)_Darwinism piece connects the quantum and classical world by saying that classical states with any classical bits are those quantum states that survived the process of decoherence, where decoherence is system's interaction aka entagling with the environment which results in loss of information. To minimize decoherence in quantum computers so that particle entaglement performing parralelized quantum computations isnt broken, one has to isolate the system and cool it down a lot. The survival of classical states is usually implemented by creating a lot of redundant information, so information about spin, location, or space can be located in the entaglement network we measure. Space and time can be seen as a quantum error correcting code. [Is Spacetime a Quantum Error-Correcting Code? | John Preskill - YouTube]([Is Spacetime a Quantum Error-Correcting Code? | John Preskill - YouTube]([Is Spacetime a Quantum Error-Correcting Code? | John Preskill - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2rlQVfnK0))) Quantum entaglement can be seen as the glue of spacetime. [Entanglement as the Glue of Spacetime - YouTube]([Entanglement as the Glue of Spacetime - YouTube]([Entanglement as the Glue of Spacetime - YouTube]([Entanglement as the Glue of Spacetime - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxY1PK4wW1I)))) Where local more entaglement encodes less distance and less local energy. [From Quantum Mechanics to Spacetime - Qiskit Seminar Series with Sean Carroll - YouTube]([From Quantum Mechanics to Spacetime - Qiskit Seminar Series with Sean Carroll - YouTube]([From Quantum Mechanics to Spacetime - Qiskit Seminar Series with Sean Carroll - YouTube]([From Quantum Mechanics to Spacetime - Qiskit Seminar Series with Sean Carroll - YouTube]([From Quantum Mechanics to Spacetime - Qiskit Seminar Series with Sean Carroll - YouTube]([From Quantum Mechanics to Spacetime - Qiskit Seminar Series with Sean Carroll - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-ct1IlGUOw)))))) Second law thermodynamics defines the arrow of time. Quantum version of second law of thermodynamics posits that entropy corresponding to entaglement is increasing overtime. The more overall entaglement there is, the futher global "time slice" of the universe it is. [How Quantum Entanglement Creates Entropy - YouTube]([How Quantum Entanglement Creates Entropy - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgYQglmYU-8)) I'm gonna stay with this framework. Other options in physics is loop quantum gravity, where spacetime is emergent from loops, more abstract quantized spacetime [Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity)))))))))))))) , or string theory where spacetime is certain configuration of strings. 

===Quantum formulation of the free energy principle===

What is the role of an observer? Let's formulate quantum version of the free energy principle.

What exists is a network of conscious observers. An observer corresponds to a cone-cocone diagram, which is a mathematically abstract way of formalizing the notion of collective intelligence with various classifiers in hiearhical graph sharing same context in collective bayesian variational free energy minimization updating on a markov blanket. This observer is implemented by physics. Experiental subjective time and space is relativistic construct of each observer that can be seen as consequence of measurements of distances and causal structures [Qualia Research Institute](https://qri.org/)blog/pseudo-time-arrow [Qualia Research Institute](https://qri.org/)blog/hyperbolic-geometry-dmt [[1012.0535] Physics as Information Processing]([[1012.0535] Physics as Information Processing]([[1012.0535] Physics as Information Processing]([[1012.0535] Physics as Information Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0535)))) and acts as error correcting code and gluing and relational contextualizing of internal states which corresponds to the general definition of entaglement. Spacetime that is objectively modelled in physics corresponds to very similar mathematical construct as written above. Relativity of time can be modelled as the speed of observer's internal state updating. Wavefunctions can be seen as nonrealist by superdeterminism, where the inherent uncertainity in the wavefunction is result from mathematically unpredictable chaotic behavior and if we knew initial conditions of the universe there wouldnt be randomness. I'm gonna assume no such hidden variables exist, wavefunctions can be seen as part of the observer's models and observers share wavefunction depending on the amount of entaglement, and shared to us nonchanging relativistic physical laws is what entangles us. When an observer, that corresponds to an open (nonequilibrium) quantum physical system, such as the cortical hiearchy or overall organism, is percieving, meaning its interacting with another system with a holographic screen, it becomes statistically inseparable with it, it entangles with it. Qualia experienced by observers is classical information.

This physics model on which observers are running can be seen as just collective observers' model that approximates the world on which observers run on by the free energy principle, or that it doesnt touch fundamental reality at all because evolution maximizes for fitness and not truth [Exposing the Strange Blueprint Behind "Reality" (Donald Hoffman Interview) - YouTube]([Exposing the Strange Blueprint Behind "Reality" (Donald Hoffman Interview) - YouTube]([Exposing the Strange Blueprint Behind "Reality" (Donald Hoffman Interview) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywG3pCd7tLM))) or a realist model on which observers run on. I'm gonna go with all of those at the same time but with focus on realism for more effective science. To transcend some sense of objective updating function determining some sense of objective time that creates speed of subjective relativistic times, we can also assume that by default only network of bayesian networks implemented by particles exist and time is just entaglement amount vector in this giant graph and local embededness of individuals is just statistical separability as mentioned above. Everything happening in all possible ways exists everywhere all at once beyond spacetime, locality, separability, individuality, illusory but also totally real to us emergent infered physical and experiental phenomena.

Resistance fuels its existence instead. Various subconscious processes can be made transparent by gradual interconnection of causal metacognitive faculties with most bottom categorizing priors (such as self and other distinction or sense modalities) and dissolving them in similar conscious manner, or by subconsciously as side effect of dissolving more conscious processes that codependently arise with the subconscious ones with circular selfstabilizing causality by giving eachother evidence for existence. Our deepest priors about reality, such as repressed emotions or ontologies, tend to have tautological logic, so breaking its metastable fixed point attractor can needs lots of direct or indirect dereifying processes.

===Total freedom, potentiality for any symbolic or nonsymbolic structure===

In the ultimately deconstructed state, our minds are free to think anything about reality, they can have any bayesian priors in the statespace of consciousness.

In the beggining before thinking about anything, there is just full potentiality, there is a mental model superposition of everything being neither true nor not true, meaning that classical logic itself is another rulebased construction that can be transcended.

As we explore the world we collapse this superposition into various concrete forms as we explore various ways of looking at the world in divfferent stories we tell ourselves. 

The more overall symmetrical an experience is neurophenomenologically, the more free, the more relieving, the more pleasant it is, the more psychological valence it has.

1) establishing safe trustable context, respecting and potentially slowly expanding window of tolerance - creating more safe, trustable, loving, caring, confident, connecting, accepting, grounded (Polyvagal Therapy), relaxed, calm, powerful, forgiving, hopeful, playful (Play Theraphy) context - getting out of traumatic environment (family, work, community,...), establishing trust with healer, psychotherapist, group (Group Therapy & Peer Support Groups) or creating trustable internal memories/parts/subagents/priorities/processes - for dialog between them in Internal Family Systems), or trusting the source or background of experience (Comprehensive Resource Model)

2) in this context enabling and opening traumatic memories/parts/subagents/priorities/processes though enabling the correct related associations (Prolonged Exposure Theraphy, Brief Eclectic Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, Inner Child Work, EMDR) and putting words, feelings, imagery to it, conceptualizing it, exploring the repressed parts (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), getting access to the whole chunk of the traumatized part of the brain, or the body where trauma might be in interrelated way be stored as well as tension (Somatic Therapy), where massage or breathwork or can help as well to relax

3) in this open window for change, reframing through reliving those memories in this better context (Coherence Theraphy, Cognitive Processing Therapy), building a new connected self with less dissociation, balancing between change and acceptance, and potentially learning healthy coping strategies with any distress (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)

4) integrating into a more healthy environment with above properties, preventing further harm by learning healthy boundaries (respecting one's needs and also needs of others to certain extend) (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) and knowing environments with potential redflags that have potential for retraumatizing

Some neuroscience models assume that trauma is maladaptive bayesian beliefs with too high percision https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6961115/ or patterns of dissonance in the nervous system [Healing Trauma With Neural Annealing]([Healing Trauma With Neural Annealing]([Healing Trauma With Neural Annealing]([Qualia Research Institute](https://qri.org/)blog/neural-annealing))) that can be changed via the above memory reconsolidation process 

Various belief weakening substances like psychedelics, entactogens, dissociatives can help in belief transformation by weakening those sticky structures in the nervous system, or downers in relaxing, or betablockers in memory reconsolidation, or stimulants in focusing on the memories and so on.

(Neutral monism) Is this a question that doesn't make sense and doesn't fundamentally touch any "deeper reality" and its just mental model play? (Mysterianism) Is the dichotomy between physics and consciousness not a thing and they're one thing, is all physics conscious? (Panpsychist physicalism) Are those physical systems with some mathematical property the only individual conscious ones?

==Most useful philosophical assumptions==

I love to juggle different ontologies depending on what is currently pragmatically useful. Not being commited to any particular ontology feels extremely free and full of relief. In explorative analytical mode I am not loyal to any particular set of I love to explore what kinds of assumptions can exist and what are their advantages and disadvantages in as neutral way as possible. In explorative experiental mode I love to explore what its like to deeply experience different ways of being, such as being one with everything on open individualism or nonexistence on empty individualism or increased sense of agency and unlimited possibilities of statespace of consciousness in idealism because of less attachment to the "physical being". Being agnostic because of difficulty or impossibility of empirical testability can free oneself from not optimal lenses. Being sceptic can find out disadvantages efficiently. Seeing reality as fundamentally mysterious and nongraspable by any concepts generates tons of awe and generates openminedness and epistemic humility meaning one has no total certainity about truthness and accuracy and fundamentalism of his models by dereifying concrete beliefs. We are all one because we're all locally embedded in the global universal wave function but we are also it through fundamental interconnectedness, relationality, nonseparability of everything, no system can ever be fully isolated. We're all also slices in spacetime or nothing at all because nothing is ever permanent. We're all also observing and acting systems that are segments that come into existence and dissolve into entropy because that's pragmatic notion to navigate everyday world and to engineer neurotechnologies and do other science.

===Assumptions for science===

I'm gonna unpack this in the next section:

For science, I'm gonna asssume by empirical bayesianism constructed approximating model of reality in physicalist combination of quantum physics and quantum information theory as fundamental ontology which is also panpsychist emergentalist and is optimized for pragmatic utilitarism focused on mathemazited collective psychological valence optimalization and longtermist survival and progressive flourishing.

Empiricism assumes that truthness of a model is determined by its predictive and explanatory power guided by occam's razor. Baysianism assumes that this model is slowly determined by slow updating of its structure according to what evidence in empirical data are presented. Approximating means that all our models we assume are finding regularities in dynamics by useful approximations. 

==Fundamental structure of reality for science==

I'm gonna unpack this in the next section:

Physicalism means that what fundamentally exists are models of physics and quantum mechanics with quantum darwinism framed inside quantum information theory is our best current approximation that is set as fundamental. Panpsychist means that any unified bound individual system with information processing is a conscious entity and structure of experience corresponds to structure of it's physical dynamics and information networks. Emergentism means that the fundamental quantum physics layer/scale exists as equally as more surface classical scales such as dynamics of atoms, molecules, cells, functional brain regions, animals, societies, planets, galaxies and so on, where each scale can be studied using (quantum) information theory. 

===Classical physics===

Let's start with classical physics to make sense of macroscopic phenomena, which means lets not look at the quantum behavior of microscopic fundamental particles. Newton's law of motion helps us predict the future trajectory of an object. Thermodynamics helps us predict how concrected heat aka energy has tendency to distribute itself into the surroundings according to the second law of thermodynamics where everything goes towards entropy aka eqilibrium. There are many types of classical differential equations that help us predict behaviors of lots of types of systems, such as how computers work, dynamics of neurons or different variables when analyzing society such as evolutionary economical models.

===Information theory, Classical formulation of the free energy principle formalizing conscious agents===

Now let's talk about the free energy principle that I'm gonna use as both epistemological framework (bayesianism) and to define physics of survival. [ActInf Livestream #045.0 ~ "The free energy principle made simpler but not too simple" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #045.0 ~ "The free energy principle made simpler but not too simple" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #045.0 ~ "The free energy principle made simpler but not too simple" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #045.0 ~ "The free energy principle made simpler but not too simple" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #045.0 ~ "The free energy principle made simpler but not too simple" - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MQQKaKEXs0))))) [Dr. MAXWELL RAMSTEAD - The Physics of Survival - YouTube]([Dr. MAXWELL RAMSTEAD - The Physics of Survival - YouTube]([Dr. MAXWELL RAMSTEAD - The Physics of Survival - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qb28P7ksyE))) [Karl Friston's Unfalsifiable Free Energy Principle - YouTube]([Karl Friston's Unfalsifiable Free Energy Principle - YouTube]([Karl Friston's Unfalsifiable Free Energy Principle - YouTube]([Karl Friston's Unfalsifiable Free Energy Principle - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ1fsXQz7M4)))) https://static.miraheze.org/qualiaresearchwiki/a/af/ActiveInference.png

Free energy principle starts with definining a thing. It asks what must a thing that survives do? It must be stable. How it does that? It looks like as if its resisting the 2nd law of thermodynamics where systems tend to go towards entropy, towards disintegrated equilibrium. A thing is an open system, which means that its not fully isolated, where energy is coming inside and out of it via various entrances. It uses this energy to stabilize its structure to resist decay. 4th law of thermodynamics states that biological systems accelerate 2nd law by being a stable negentropic structure that serves as a machine that converts environment's negentropy into entropy through dissipation.

For example us eating food which is basis for our biological machine. How do we systematically find food in our environment? We must be able to predict it and act on it. How do we do that? Our brain approximates bayesian mechanics. What is that? Bayes theorem tells us the optimal way of processing information that natural selection approximately recruited in us, where the probaility of our model of the causes of our perception (aka priors) given our measured input sensory data being true aka corresponding to how it is statistically in reality can be calculated by probability of our input sensory data given our predicted causes times probability of our predicted causes, all divided by the probability of our input sensory data. [The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube]([The Bayesian Brain and Meditation - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg3cQXf4zSE))))))))))))))))) Issue is that when analytically calculating the last term we get combinatorial explosion, leading to it not being computable. Evolution sidesteps this issue by partially by evolution preprogrammed priors, such as subconsciously monitoring and influencing our blood pressure, or doing lots of partitioning of sensory data, such as dividing into different senses, doing distinctions between self and other, modelling our own ability to influence the world and so on, all of which is maintained in an always active generative model that acts as a software that looks at sensory data, compares it with our priors, and sends a prediction error if there is a mismatch, which creates evolutionary pressure to update our model of the world, such as for example changing our perspective on some issue when presented with different evidence (certain ways of thinking are stuck in rigid attractor where this mechanism of updating is malfunctioning) or for example when we see a pink unicorn dancing on a rainbow when on psychedelics we get confused and see it as outlier that probably isnt real according to our priors, but seeing lots of unicorns overtime might change our priors. This whole process reduces our uncertainity about the world.

More generally and formally, a thing corresponds to a markov blanket, which is a graph of nodes that learn correlations from its surroundings where you can locate a statistical boundary, where depending on how this particle (an observer with a reference frame) is complex [Imgur: The magic of the Internet]([Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/xHvym29)) you can locate nodes that seem to encode hidden states, meaning correlations encoding the outside world's (outside blanket's) structure, nodes that look as if they're just measuring and compressing the outside nodes, and nodes that look as if they're acting on the environment by statistical causal influence (doesnt exist in inert particles), and it tends to be nested a hieachy of markov blankets composed of markov blankets and so on, where you get dynamics of message passing and circular causal influence of the agent with the environment. Even more formally on this markov blanket a principle of least action is applied that minimizes statistical quantity of variational free energy that helps the model to be as accurate as possible while being the least complex as possible. It can be seen through the lens of thermodynamics as energy contractions and flow on this topology of information networks. You can crave certain neural classifiers or certain paths and then interconnect them via higher order nonlinear neural connections. The probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge about a system is the one with largest information entropy aka avarage amount of information or uncertainity inherent to the variable's possible outcomes. (generalization of thermodynamic entropy) [Principle of maximum entropy - Wikipedia]([Principle of maximum entropy - Wikipedia]([Principle of maximum entropy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy))) All of those insights can be used for ideal rational epistemology!

===Quantum physics===

We've covered classical physics so far, now let's look at quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is a general framework that can be used to study evolution and dynamics of particles like in classical physics, but instead of objects and particles as deterministic points or shapes in classical 3D space, their classical information becomes inherently probabilistic and a concept of entanglement is introduced that says that any two systems that are entagled are inseparable. When we apply quantum mechanics to the fundamental particles level, particles are represented using complex valued wave function that evolves the probability distribution of the possible particle's classical properties. In quantum electrodynamics [Quantum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum)_electrodynamics or standard model or quantum field theory in general, particles are excitations of matter and interaction quantum fields that fill all of space.

===Unifying quantum with the classical, Quantum darwinism or other options===

Quantum darwinism [Quantum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum)_Darwinism piece connects the quantum and classical world by saying that classical states with any classical bits are those quantum states that survived the process of decoherence, where decoherence is system's interaction aka entagling with the environment which results in loss of information. To minimize decoherence in quantum computers so that particle entaglement performing parralelized quantum computations isnt broken, one has to isolate the system and cool it down a lot. The survival of classical states is usually implemented by creating a lot of redundant information, so information about spin, location, or space can be located in the entaglement network we measure. Space and time can be seen as a quantum error correcting code. [Is Spacetime a Quantum Error-Correcting Code? | John Preskill - YouTube]([Is Spacetime a Quantum Error-Correcting Code? | John Preskill - YouTube]([Is Spacetime a Quantum Error-Correcting Code? | John Preskill - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW2rlQVfnK0))) Quantum entaglement can be seen as the glue of spacetime. [Entanglement as the Glue of Spacetime - YouTube]([Entanglement as the Glue of Spacetime - YouTube]([Entanglement as the Glue of Spacetime - YouTube]([Entanglement as the Glue of Spacetime - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxY1PK4wW1I)))) Where local more entaglement encodes less distance and less local energy. [From Quantum Mechanics to Spacetime - Qiskit Seminar Series with Sean Carroll - YouTube]([From Quantum Mechanics to Spacetime - Qiskit Seminar Series with Sean Carroll - YouTube]([From Quantum Mechanics to Spacetime - Qiskit Seminar Series with Sean Carroll - YouTube]([From Quantum Mechanics to Spacetime - Qiskit Seminar Series with Sean Carroll - YouTube]([From Quantum Mechanics to Spacetime - Qiskit Seminar Series with Sean Carroll - YouTube]([From Quantum Mechanics to Spacetime - Qiskit Seminar Series with Sean Carroll - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-ct1IlGUOw)))))) Second law thermodynamics defines the arrow of time. Quantum version of second law of thermodynamics posits that entropy corresponding to entaglement is increasing overtime. The more overall entaglement there is, the futher global "time slice" of the universe it is. [How Quantum Entanglement Creates Entropy - YouTube]([How Quantum Entanglement Creates Entropy - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgYQglmYU-8)) I'm gonna stay with this framework. Other options in physics is loop quantum gravity, where spacetime is emergent from loops, more abstract quantized spacetime [Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia]([Loop quantum gravity - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity)))))))))))))) , or string theory where spacetime is certain configuration of strings. Standard model quantum field theory is good because its the most empirically validated and not flying in string theoretic abstractions where supersymmetry is in danger. https://imgur.com/1CefH68

===Quantum formulation of the free energy principle===

What is the role of an observer? Let's formulate quantum version of the free energy principle. [ActInf Livestream #040.0 ~ "A free energy principle for generic quantum systems" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #040.0 ~ "A free energy principle for generic quantum systems" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #040.0 ~ "A free energy principle for generic quantum systems" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #040.0 ~ "A free energy principle for generic quantum systems" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #040.0 ~ "A free energy principle for generic quantum systems" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #040.0 ~ "A free energy principle for generic quantum systems" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #040.0 ~ "A free energy principle for generic quantum systems" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #040.0 ~ "A free energy principle for generic quantum systems" - YouTube]([ActInf Livestream #040.0 ~ "A free energy principle for generic quantum systems" - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qZYxSbJ38E))))))))) [Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023](https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/fields-physics-2023)))))))))))))))))) Entaglement is fully generally nonseparability of two quantum systems, therefore it is equivalent with bayesian coherence, correlation, emergence, conditional dependence, it giving information, it having causal influence. What exists is a network of conscious observers. An observer corresponds to a cone-cocone diagram, which is a mathematically abstract way of formalizing the notion of collective intelligence with various classifiers in hiearhical graph sharing same context in collective bayesian variational free energy minimization updating on a markov blanket. This observer is implemented by physics. Experiental subjective time and space is relativistic construct of each observer that can be seen as consequence of measurements of distances and causal structures [Qualia Research Institute](https://qri.org/)blog/pseudo-time-arrow [Qualia Research Institute](https://qri.org/)blog/hyperbolic-geometry-dmt [[1012.0535] Physics as Information Processing]([[1012.0535] Physics as Information Processing]([[1012.0535] Physics as Information Processing]([[1012.0535] Physics as Information Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0535)))) and acts as error correcting code and gluing and relational contextualizing of internal states which corresponds to the general definition of entaglement. Spacetime that is objectively modelled in physics corresponds to very similar mathematical construct as written above. Relativity of time can be modelled as the speed of observer's internal state updating. Wavefunctions can be seen as nonrealist by superdeterminism, where the inherent uncertainity in the wavefunction is result from mathematically unpredictable chaotic behavior and if we knew initial conditions of the universe there wouldnt be randomness. I'm gonna assume no such hidden variables exist, wavefunctions can be seen as part of the observer's models and observers share wavefunction depending on the amount of entaglement, and shared to us nonchanging physical laws is what entangles us. When an observer, that corresponds to an open (nonequilibrium) quantum physical system, such as the cortical hiearchy or overall organism, is percieving, meaning its interacting with another system with a holographic screen, it becomes statistically inseparable with it, it entangles with it. Qualia experienced by observers is classical information.

This physics model on which observers are running can be seen as just collective observers' model that approximates the world on which observers run on by the free energy principle, or that it doesnt touch fundamental reality at all because evolution maximizes for fitness and not truth [Exposing the Strange Blueprint Behind "Reality" (Donald Hoffman Interview) - YouTube]([Exposing the Strange Blueprint Behind "Reality" (Donald Hoffman Interview) - YouTube]([Exposing the Strange Blueprint Behind "Reality" (Donald Hoffman Interview) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywG3pCd7tLM))) or a realist model on which observers run on. I'm gonna go with all of those at the same time but with focus on realism for more effective science. To transcend some sense of objective updating function determining some sense of objective time that creates speed of subjective relativistic times, we can also assume that by default only network of bayesian networks implemented by particles exist and time is just entaglement amount vector in this giant graph and local embededness of individuals is just statistical separability as mentioned above. Everything happening in all possible ways exists everywhere all at once beyond spacetime, locality, separability, individuality, illusory but also totally real to us emergent infered physical and experiental phenomena.

===Emergence of all other scientific fields inside this framework===

Let's apply free energy principle scalefree and create a nested hiearchy of markov blankets corresponding to things governed by evolutionary equations of physics. [Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023](https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/fields-physics-2023)))))))))))))))))) [[2303.04898] A variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics]([[2303.04898] A variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics]([[2303.04898] A variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics]([[2303.04898] A variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics]([[2303.04898] A variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04898))))) On the most bottom level, things correspond to particles, those form higher order things with their own markov blanket such as molecules, proteins, cells, neurons, functional brain regions, animals [ShieldSquare Captcha]([ShieldSquare Captcha]([ShieldSquare Captcha]([ShieldSquare Captcha]([ShieldSquare Captcha]([ShieldSquare Captcha](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4386/aca7de)/meta))))) , people, communities, states, superpowers, planets, galaxies and so on. Higher scale implies higher complexity of dynamics. The complexity can be deflated by various differential equations used in different scientific fields. More generally its nested cone-cocone diagrams.

Minimize complexity of models by minimizing possible free parameters (Huxley neuron formalism has a lot of free parameters but theory of superconductivity doesn't)

Different Markov blankets in nature minimize free energy of their model in different niches to infer the biggest important information as possible in the least amount of bits

Cells in ebryos look for concetration of proteins in their surroundingse to infer their position

Visual systems estimiting motion looks for change in pixels times difference between neighbouring pixels

As we go to top scales in sciences we seek to minimize more and more free parameters, we want to be as closest as possible to deepest fundamental dynamics while not being lost in free parameters [2017 Buhl Lecture: The Physics of Life: How Much Can We Calculate by William Bialek - YouTube]([2017 Buhl Lecture: The Physics of Life: How Much Can We Calculate by William Bialek - YouTube](https://youtu.be/EmhRxeq9-_0))

So, if we wanna describe all natural scientific fields in one model using the quantum formulation of the free energy principle or overall quantum information theory and fundamental physics, we can use it to formalize the fundamental relationality of information in any other scientific discipline that studies arbitrary quantum systems that may or may not have classical correspondences in various models, where all models are useful approximations and evolutionary niches. [[2303.04898] A variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics]([[2303.04898] A variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics]([[2303.04898] A variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics]([[2303.04898] A variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics]([[2303.04898] A variational synthesis of evolutionary and developmental dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04898))))) All the mathematical models or differential equations used to predict dynamics in chemistry, biology, sociology, ecosystem science, astrophysics and so on are different special cases or approximations of those underlying quantum dynamics in quantum reference frames with holographic screens for communication that cause higher order causal information processing with agentic free energy minimizing modelling in nested hieachical bayesian graph and acting across scales. Can this be formalized as multiple cocone diagrams forming higher order cocone diagrams by informorphisms encoding higher order semantic information, a cocone diagram where nodes are themselves cocone diagrams, not just classifiers and semantics. Are the fundamental classifiers nonreducible information processing in physics, corresponding to the simpliest information processing of subatomic particles or excitations or loops or strings or something else, that together form collective information processing with shared context in a cocone diagram and that forms again higher order cocone diagrams up to theoretical infinity? Is this the nature of emergence of collective intelligences from collective intelligences? From (inert) simple interacting subatomic particles or other fundamental entity (that through entaglement form the quantum error correcting glue of spacetime) to atoms to molecules to cells to brain regions to brains to organisms [ShieldSquare Captcha]([ShieldSquare Captcha]([ShieldSquare Captcha]([ShieldSquare Captcha]([ShieldSquare Captcha]([ShieldSquare Captcha](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4386/aca7de)/meta))))) to communities to cultures to nation states to planetary systems to galaxies and so on, from lower order quantum information theoretic goals that bind and form a unit together getting higher order goals by this nested fractal cocone collective bayesian free energy minimizing information processing structure with top down and bottom up causality across scales performing active inference, where classical or quantum differential equations describing them tend to get more and more complex with increasing structural information processing complexity, but in some cases we can locate simple laws acting as good enough approximation for its context that can also sometimes be transposed across many contexts, is that convergent evolution of nature balancing between simplicity and complexity on all scales?

Is wellbeing based in efficient uncertanity reducing colelctive behavior of various information processing subagents in the nervous system creating symmetrical dynamics that is interconnected with having shared context with other humans and overall collective reduction of basic needs among time?

Is metacrisis solving the cancerous dynamics, many misalinged active inference agents with the collective's long term wellbeing by strenghtening those aligned goals and reminder of interconnectivity and relationity of sciences and worldviews through education or AI assistants? Is consumerism hijacking our attentional limbic mechanisms and how we evolved to have lots of pleasure from things that used to be very rare in the past so that we would look for them (sugar, fat, important shocking news, porn etc.) For alignment and, do we cultivate culture of compassion. For wellbeing do we strenghten mental health knowledge and reduce environmental and information polution that destroys us? Do we strenghten democracy while teaching people about the metacrisis and polycrisis so that good political representitves are selected? What are the most effective interventions to our system that will a) increase the wellbeing of human population, b) increase collective efficient mitigation and resolving of symptoms and causes of risks and crises and c) making efficient material and psychological (that complement eachother) progress leading to flourishing. And how all those factors interconnect. How to make them respect, support and check eachother instead of fighting violently. Different people speak with different fundamental languages determining their actions so if one wants to change their action one should synchronize with their objective functions. Politics is a lot about the language of power. Corporations speak the language of money. Language of values. Language of ideology? Language of morality (appealing to politician's children's future life). Language of meaningful experiences and meaning in general. Supercooperators are the golden nugget against the metacrisis. What are the best evolutionary pressures for supercooperation clusters? Supercooperatior universities? Ctraining theory of mind and shared goal states via commpassion and dialog, psychedelics, meditation, unity, opposite of polarization, nonduality, cultivate holistic planetary awareness? Could massemailing people that have the biggest causal influence in determining humanity's trajectory while synchronizing as most as possible with their language lead to efficient evolutionary pressure towards a good third attractor that isnt dystopia like Russia and chaos like Somalia? What else is needed to make strong enough good evolutionary pressure in the evolution of societal architecture such that we dont selfdestruct eachother with existencial risks and environmental destruction? How to install altruistic dynamics into governing structures that are very much governed by power and money dynamics without becoming the memeplex transmittor of the language of power of money but instead a memeplex transmittor increasing chances of global supercooperation cluster?

Resistance fuels its existence instead. Various subconscious processes can be made transparent by gradual interconnection of causal metacognitive faculties with most bottom categorizing priors (such as self and other distinction or sense modalities) and dissolving them in similar conscious manner, or by subconsciously as side effect of dissolving more conscious processes that codependently arise with the subconscious ones with circular selfstabilizing causality by giving eachother evidence for existence.

In the beggining before thinking about anything, there is just full potentiality, there is a mental model superposition of everything being neither true nor not true, meaning that classical logic itself is another rulebased construction that can be transcended.

As we explore the world we collapse this superposition into various concrete forms as we explore various ways of looking at the world in divfferent stories we tell ourselves. 

The more overall symmetrical an experience is neurophenomenologically, the more free, the more relieving, the more pleasant it is, the more psychological valence it has. 

===Intelligence===

What is nature of (human) (general) intelligence? Identifying self-organizing principles, information geometries in physics, that are energetically cheap, maximizing total amount of information by compressing, reducing uncertainity adaptively flexibly dynamically, which can solve the problem for you?

More linear deep specialized networks, better narrow intelligence, but risk of overfitting, induced by stimulants or constructive meditation/learning, DMT? Less symmetry breaking, easier thermodynamic flow, easier information processing, more nonlinear graph theoretic structrure or chaos, more compressed correlated data, more higher order semantic information (informophisms on top of raw concrete neurophenomenological classifiers), more general intelligence creating high level connections, but risk of underfittting too much, induced by deconstructive meditation, 5-MeO-DMT? Network that supports both dynamically and flexibly with efficient internal communication, induced by combination of constructive and deconstructive meditation/learning, LSD?

What genes we got, in what environment we grew up in, what do we do, together form the structure of the brain which is where happiness is stored. How does it look like in the brain? I will explain it more in detail below. Many of those factors overlap and influence eachother across levels.

Brain is like a metal. When it gets used in activities that take effort, you start to feel tearing and inconsistencies in your experience, less symmetries in the metal's (brain's) structure (tissue and activity). The smoother the metal is, the more pleasant it feels. Activities that energize you, that I list below (in the sense that they make you less tired, increase energy parameter of then nervous system), heat up this metal, that starts to melt and fill up the tears and reconfigure the metal into a more symmetrical shape, which then cools down (integration) and you feel more peaceful, calm, relaxed, energized, smooth, happy, in flow, effortless, blissful, joyous, loving, connected, holistic, complete, fullfilled, in the moment,...<ref>[[Thinking Like a Musical Instrument or Psychoactive Substances Give Access to the Nature of Brains - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqRA2m9zlns) Thinking Like a Musical Instrument or Psychoactive Substances Give Access to the Nature of Brains, Qualia Productions, 2022]</ref>

Symmetrifications are done mostly through the process of annealing. (for example meditation) Some symmetrifications might be symmetrifying in the short term but asymmetrifying in the long term through oscillatory dynamics such as the hedonic treadmill. (too frequent dopaminogenic activities) Hedonic treadmill isn't an universal rule, many activities such as meditation can permanently shift the baseline hedonic state. Some global dissonant asymmetries can be kept alive by local consonant symmetrifications that feel good temporarily. (for example substances like heroin that mute the mind's pain (because of trauma or high energy depression for example) on the surface without dealing with the cause) 

List all symmetrifications:

Individual scale: 

My most efficient annealing techniques that I combine with eachother. Each of them raise the energy parameter of experience and tend to dissolve local dualistic structures in favor of more global interconnected structure that manifest as high level connections insights and overall sense of less blocked experience, and also satisfies other kinds of basic needs:

Loving do nothing deconstructive meditation

Walking and running in nature

Reading/Listening to big picture thinking

Hot shower/bath

Talking about the depths of my mind with myself or with others or by writing

Deep slow meditative mindful tantric interaction with other people

Psychedelics, shrooms, LSD or 5-MeO-DMT - Shrooms is more dissolving but still full of interesting loving complexity, LSD focuses on concrete task more such as learning, 5-MeO-DMT just dissolves everything beyond concepts and tasks

====My favorite meditation algorithm====
Dissolve concrete local stabilizing structural energy sinks such as thoughts, intentions, imagery, concepts, ideas, abstract thought, conditioned classified objects as constructed subsets of raw sense data with added abstract structure and feelings about them, percieving raw sensations themself, by tuning into quiet vast still spacious empty boundaryless centerless awareness, empty awake space, quieting the mind. See the emptiness (dreamlikeness) and dissolve global fundamental stabilizing stuctural energy sinks behind everything that form the sense of ground in experience by classifying and freeying them by for example nociting global relaxation and their spacious lightness - sense of doer, attention, watcher, self and other distinction, time, space, boundary, center, coordinates, background, knowing, local and global being, truths, ontology, somethingness, perception, nonperception, neither perception nor not perception, trancending the transcendence itself, any "fundamental" classifications, dissolve any logic, any distinctions, any structures in general. Destabilizing any codependently mutually (self)stabilizing clusters of symbolic or intuitive processes by raw not knowing and looking without concepts by generating stochasticity. After this deconstruction into unified stochastic void when everything starts reconstructing, throw in infinite love, kindness, caring, connectedness, healing, light, meaningfulness, protecting, cherishing, safety, comfort, smoothness for all mental objects that emerge in any reconstructed emerged dual category by imagining a deity of compassion radiating wisdom, love, kindness, caring in all directions, merging with her, helping infinite beings using infinite limbs relieve their suffering and feel the best poisitive valence experience they have the potential to feel full of inifinite love and wellbeing, including you as you are a being too, she, aka you, has love for totally every being.

====Neural Annealing in practice====

You can energize (reinforce) mental objects by directing attentional arrow to it, by it being aligned with valence gradient (aethetics, resolving basic needs), sensory data (what aligns with "reality" or imagined expectations is reinforced), surprise (prediction error adds entropic activity to fix prediction errors to tune models by finding policies to edit internal models or act on the world), you can also modify (transform) it into a more consonant symmetrical shape, you can energize it so much that its dissolves by overwhelming, you can weaken attentional resources (forces) by globalizing them (attention to background stillness, vastness, silentness, boundarylessness, centerlessness, infinityness,...) resulting in global smoothening as local topological shapes in the neural tissue through global acticity gets more coarsegrained, more smoothened, more redistributed, and you can also avoid mental objects.

Love or seeing constructedness (illusorynessness) of mental phenomena seems to be an universal dissolver of any mental object or conditioned reactive patterns of behavior canalizations. Or explicit relaxation of any contracted qualia.

Canalized Mr Meeseeks protective subagents - dissolve by showing them counterfactual proof that they dont need to be so defensive in a new environment and that they can relax.

Dissolving held psychotic (misaligned with other processes or destructive rather than helping) beliefs with showing them opposite evidence, relativizing them away.

Avoiding overly protective subagents by not getting into hostile environments or consume limbic hijacking fear inducing memeplexes on social media or news. Satisfy the objective functions and create compromises in your whole ecosystem of subagents having different priotiries, don't isolate any as then he tends to canalize protective structures hostile against others.

Depressive beliefs such as "Everyone always leaves", "People look at me like they hate me", "I am afraid I will say something stupid" are also dissolvable with counterfactual evidence. One can create a dialog between the hurt subagent and a "healer" subagent, asking about what it is, what its priorities are, how it was formed, what other beliefs or subagents it depends on

Some linguistic or abstract mental construction is seen as true if many observes agree on its validity using different epistemological strategies, beliefs present in a population can be disrupted or reinforced or novel ones created by mutating or creating a new belief that is compatible with the culture's current aethetics (superstructure framing priors that are preffered according to their consonance with the whole) and spreading it succesfully darwinianly.

Any neural operator (psychotool or a substance) that symmetrifies neurophenomenology tends to also increase energy, probably because of disintegration of energy sinks so unsinked energy flows randomly with much less attracting forces, which might lead to seeing visuals as well.

Energy sink can act as a neural classifier taking sensory data as input and outputing other thoughts or actions. Low energy depression seems to be damping energy through no learned agency. (hopelessness isnt learned, its that no agency is learned [Helplessness Is Not Learned - Neurofrontiers]([Helplessness Is Not Learned - Neurofrontiers]([Helplessness Is Not Learned - Neurofrontiers](https://neurofrontiers.blog/helplessness-is-not-learned/))) ) Which might be seen as no sensory patters cascading into possible actions, no dopaminogentic motivation. Symmetrical representations can create global cascade of activation of neural representations from just one through more interconnected neural topology (meditation and psychedelics increase that). We can damp energy by getting into gettign stuck into some one solid mental object. One can collapse from deconstructed entropic state back into some highly specialized context to concetrate all that free computational power into one task and use it all there, its asymmetry (high overfitted specialization) can damp overall energy.

Any mental and physical activity that increases energy follows period of decreased energy, so thats a way to overall dampen energy as well. The stronger the increase, the stronger the decrease tends to be. Gradual increasing can be achieved by slow gradual increase such that neural networks adapt to a new baseline, just like progressive overload in fitness.

When it comes to shifting energy from one task to another one, one can in the global context see reason for doing that to generate motivation. We climb valence gradients realized as error reduction slopes of solving the problem better than expected, so depending on our aethtics and current problems we solve in life, we can shift our attention by lubricating those fundamental objective functions in our deepest bayesian priors, which also increases wellbeing through increased sense of meaning and motivation and reduces procrasination.

More trust, more bayesian prior, aethetics, goal synchronization, leads to more efficient belief transmission, more efficient updating of maladaptive priors. Ideal psychotherapheutic setting definitely depends on the cultural aethetics of the client - some people are raised religious, some secular, some think more in mechanistic terms, some think more in fantasy narratives and so on.

Songs are definitely also subjective to high degree as they active consonant memories through context dependant associations leading to good transformative trips.

Songs with long global consonant tones are great for global information processing. Extremely fast songs are good at local information processing. Some songs have both in parallel which is great for combined information processing.

In the extremely deconstructed meditation/psychedelics induced states, no concrete selforganized collective of problem solving subagents (clusters of coherence) fighting for attention but instead the contents of the field of consciousness is dissolved into one giant wave of mostly nonclassifying symmetrical activity (example jhanas, sense of merging with God) with some highly symmetrical structures forming as source of beauty (example nature, poetry, art), which is all also present in (nondual) (optimistic nihhilism) philosophies (just being, being like water (flow state not interrupted by rigid concrete expectations), seeing beauty in everyday things), trance is energizing by repeating (symmetrical) stacked patterns in sensory modelities that's overriding existing potentially dissonant patterns creating global symmetrical metastable attractor mind state that can be futher reinforced internally or from the environment by compatible proofs or overall tautological logic.

===Agency===

Great talk about how limited metacognitive agency over thought and preferences is implemented in the mind [Conversation between Mark Solms, Chris Fields, and Mike Levin 2 - YouTube]([Conversation between Mark Solms, Chris Fields, and Mike Levin 2 - YouTube]([Conversation between Mark Solms, Chris Fields, and Mike Levin 2 - YouTube](https://youtu.be/1S4jaYjuzm0)))

aka the ability to decide what your next thought and preferences will be is limited by our phenotype (the set of observable characteristics or traits of an organism (in this case of our mind)) emerging from genetic and environmental influences

Technically Big five model of personality or Jung's archetypes are describing phenotypes

By being raised in specific culture also determines a phenotype in thinking and behavior

In dynamical systems language its an attractor

There also seem to be various neural correlates that determine the strength of forms of agency, such as disconnection of certain brain regions in unconctollable destructive addictive behavior.

Someone should invest heavily in brain computer interfaces enhancing the control over ourselves by strenghtening those neural networks üòÉ

I find this as fascinating start when it comes to decoding thoughts [Semantic reconstruction of continuous language from non-invasive brain recordings | bioRxiv]([Semantic reconstruction of continuous language from non-invasive brain recordings | bioRxiv]([Semantic reconstruction of continuous language from non-invasive brain recordings | bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.29.509744v1)))

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811923004068 (Disentangling the neural correlates of agency, ownership and multisensory processing)

Hmm here they locate what goes wrong in decreased sense of agency [Neural correlates of sense of agency in motor control: A neuroimaging meta-analysis - PubMed]([Neural correlates of sense of agency in motor control: A neuroimaging meta-analysis - PubMed]([Neural correlates of sense of agency in motor control: A neuroimaging meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32502189/)))

I would argue the development of the networks implementing healthy sense of agency needs to be fundamentally supported by training them like muscles (genetics also play a role) so there's evolutionary pressures for them to be developed. This seems to be the fuction of certain meditation practices, going out of comfort zone practices, systematic dedication to one bigger task skill, stabilizing routine skill, or delayed gratification practices ü§î

Its also interesting how stimulants or lower doses of psychedelics tend to increase agency

===Compassion===

Compassion is fundamental mental muscle to cultivating strong human relationships that are number one predictor of individual and collective wellbeing. We need more culture of compassion in our culture.

We take so many to us deeply important human connections for granted and when they start dissapearing we start to see their true worth.

Be grateful, compassionate, connect, love.

It fascinates me how people on the death bed tend to care much less about how much money and work they did, but that they should have strenghtened the human connections with those they love the most that might be gone already leading to strong griefing.

I love one lens on psychotheraphy, that lots of psychotherapeuts see their clients mechanistically and try to look for a mechanistic problem that needs to be solved according to predefined symbolic trees/ methodologies. This definitely has its use and should be used a lot, but fusing rationality with intuition is IMO ideal. But I would argue that to fully understand the lens of the other beings that might be deeply suffering, one should try to synchronize with them as much as possible mentally. Get as much as possible into their world by listening as deeply as possible, synchronizing breathing itself can increase sense of connection. [Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.783694/full))))))) Being in the present moment with the other as deeply as possible, almost fusing together mentally and this way finding solutions by using the deepest intuition. Something like tends to be practiced in Gestalt psychotherapheutic method for example. The deep compassion definitely has its advantages and disadvantages, as feeling the suffering of others so directly can really overwhelm one's mental state if not enough healing to get back into less suffering states is done. It also seems that in the current loneliness crisis, therapheuts tend to be the only people that create at least some human connection for some people that feel fundamentally lonely. We need more culture of compassion for people to feel more connected to eachother.

[Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.783694/full))))))) Being in the present moment with the other as deeply as possible, almost fusing together mentally and this way finding solutions by using the deepest intuition. Something like tends to be practiced in Gestalt psychotherapheutic method for example. The deep compassion definitely has its advantages and disadvantages, as feeling the suffering of others so directly can really overwhelm one's mental state if not enough healing to get back into less suffering states is done. It also seems that in the current loneliness crisis, therapheuts tend to be the only people that create at least some human connection for some people that feel fundamentally lonely. We need more culture of compassion for people to feel more connected to eachother.

Connectedness with us, others, the world and everything everywhere in all timescales.

These experiences are full of infinite value and meaning beyond individual comprehesion.

===Meaning and selfactualization===

====Hyperspecific obsession====
After basic needs are met, hyperspecialized ecosystem of aligned problem solving subagents in one mind or collective that build structure by acting on mental states (example intellectual growth learning) (example sciences, philosophy, art, fantasy, knowing everything about rocks, theories of everything) or the world (example pragmatic application of knowledge in the real word towards some less or more grandiose visions) (example hobbies, engineering, cars, computers)

====Community - social graph====
Leader, or collective of leaders (governing structures), has hyperspecific obsession, lead the collective into its wellness by high level management of subagents, (example state ideologies, utopian visions, collective risks) giving concrete meanings with common goal signaling by visions to the collective's parts by outsourcing needed actions (example engineering, science progress, and application, knowledge growth, solving basic needs, wellbeing engineering, surviving, managing existencial risks, upgrading, evolving, growing, entertainment, unifying culture engineering, engineering access to novel experiences or ways to relax, science communication, minimizing friction in ecosystem of interacting diverse differently evolutionary specialized total mental frameworks aka world views aka lenses aka points of view aka ways of seeing (evolutionary adapted hiearchy of bayesian priors forming homeostatic problem solving subagents through interaction interaction and with the environment by reading/writing states, reading signals reinforcing current state or pointing to or forcing change from others, sending signals aka massage passing in active inference)), beating outgroups in status and power (even tho noncooperative zero sum games of groups competing for same resources probably lead to disaster for everyone) (ingroup outgroup divisions are increased by individualization, increase of languages of what divides us, loss of languages of what unites us)

Relationships, family - similar to community but on lower scales, they tend to be bound by implicit biological synchronizations, but that seems to get dissolved in more psychologically or physically intimite, or polyamory communities, then there are people with lone wolf philosophy that are very individualistic.

====Entropic dissolution into everything====
In the extremely deconstructed meditation/psychedelics induced states, no concrete selforganized collective of problem solving subagents (clusters of coherence) fighting for attention but instead the contents of the field of consciousness is dissolved into one giant wave of mostly nonclassifying symmetrical activity (example jhanas, sense of merging with God) with some highly symmetrical structures forming as source of beauty (example nature, poetry, art), which is all also present in (nondual) (optimistic nihhilism) philosophies (just being, being like water (flow state not interrupted by rigid concrete expectations), seeing beauty in everyday things), trance is energizing by repeating (symmetrical) stacked patterns in sensory modelities that's overriding existing potentially dissonant patterns creating global symmetrical metastable attractor mind state that can be futher reinforced internally or from the environment by compatible proofs or overall tautological logic.

====Generalized meaning of life====

We are attempting to find what is in us out there. We are selfactualizing, selfevidencing. Trying to align what we predict as perfect homeostatic conditions about us and the world with what we measure by changing environment through changing our inner models or by changing our environment thorugh actions. Trying reduce uncertainity about our conditions for hardwired basic needs and culturally learned objective functions, of our hiearchical graph of subagents. Trying to create synchrony between the self model and world model. Reducing uncertainity/dissonance -> increasing relaxation, destressification -> symmetrification. Flow state might be seen as stress source that is unstressing everything else in experience, even that stress can be dissolved on meditation and psychedelics. Good predictor and regulator of a system must be a model of that system.

===Cessations===

Cessations are decrease in neural synchronization in alpha bandwith, dissolution of functional integration, functional linking between different ares of the brain, break down of coordinated message passing, increased phase lag index measure [Ep201: Revealing Nirodha SamaÃÑpatti - Delson Armstrong, Shinzen Young, Chelsey Fasano, Dr Laukkonen - YouTube]([Ep201: Revealing Nirodha SamaÃÑpatti - Delson Armstrong, Shinzen Young, Chelsey Fasano, Dr Laukkonen - YouTube]([Ep201: Revealing Nirodha SamaÃÑpatti - Delson Armstrong, Shinzen Young, Chelsey Fasano, Dr Laukkonen - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEWAerJKOs))) [EEG Connectivity Using Phase Lag Index - Sapien Labs | Neuroscience | Human Brain Diversity Project]([EEG Connectivity Using Phase Lag Index - Sapien Labs | Neuroscience | Human Brain Diversity Project]([EEG Connectivity Using Phase Lag Index - Sapien Labs | Neuroscience | Human Brain Diversity Project]([EEG Connectivity Using Phase Lag Index - Sapien Labs | Neuroscience | Human Brain Diversity Project](https://sapienlabs.org/lab-talk/eeg-connectivity-using-phase-lag-index/))))

Suffering and fear is caused by the mental objects we construct and we can unlearn doing that using this process of dissolution of local nonlinearities where distincting objects are stored in the connectome as rigid structure. With no objects there "is" just some effortless flowy undisturbed nonconconceptual happening by its own.

===DMT entities and gods===

DMT entities and Gods are higher order selfsynchronizing superselfmetaprogramming agent metaprocesss, usually outside of self model's agency, editable indirectly, you can merge with them, such as with god of compassion on meditation, or the God of Everything on 5-MeO-DMT as global coherence of clusters of brain dynamics, dissolving internal boundaries. DMT entities can be seen as competing clusters of coherence.

DMT entities and Gods are standard background noise of self stabilizing software agents that normally parasitize on organismic information processing networks but get amplified when you blow yourself out of your brain on psychedelics. 

Gods are metaphors for nonsymbolic aka intuitionbased aka Fristonian free energetic force or attractors in the neurophenomenological statespace.

They are usually some extreme of the psyche,: freedom, unity, suffering. Or symbolisms for something: fertility, sea, underworld, art.

DMT entities can be projections of sociodynamic landscapes. For example, Jesters/Clowns/Harlequins express "narcissistic vibrational modes" of consciousness. Their traps & childish playpen energy is a manifestation of conditional love.

Bodhisattva energy, on the other hand, is a manifestation of unconditional love modes of consciousness. It's such a different kind of vibrational landscape!

DMT can help you see what kind of social dynamics you are subconsciously modeling as your "default mode of interaction". <ref>[https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1602578160943599617 Andr√©s G√≥mez Emilsson tweet]</ref>

DMT activates a notion of observing foundational agency, while dissociating the individual self. Fractalized agency = machine elves, Gaia-ized agency = Pascha Mama, unified agency = cosmic consciousness, contracted unified agency = cosmic core <ref>[https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1364675761781628928 Joscha Bach tweet]</ref>

With classic psychedelics, which stand somewhere between DMT and 5-MeO-DMT in their level of global coherence, you always go through an annealing process before finally ‚Äúsnapping‚Äù into global coherence and ‚Äúbecoming one with God‚Äù. That coherence is the signature of these mystical experiences becomes rather self-evident once you pay attention to annealing signatures (i.e. noticing how incompatible metronomes slowly start synchronizing and forming larger and larger structures until one megastructure swallows it all and dissolves the self-other boundary in the process of doing so).<ref>[[On Rhythms of the Brain: Jhanas, Local Field Potentials, and Electromagnetic Theories of Consciousness | Qualia  Computing]([On Rhythms of the Brain: Jhanas, Local Field Potentials, and Electromagnetic Theories of Consciousness | Qualia  Computing]([On Rhythms of the Brain: Jhanas, Local Field Potentials, and Electromagnetic Theories of Consciousness | Qualia  Computing]([On Rhythms of the Brain: Jhanas, Local Field Potentials, and Electromagnetic Theories of Consciousness | Qualia  Computing](https://qualiacomputing.com/2022/10/27/on-rhythms-of-the-brain-jhanas-local-field-potentials-and-electromagnetic-theories-of-consciousness/)))) On Rhythms of the Brain: Jhanas, Local Field Potentials, and Electromagnetic Theories of Consciousness]</ref>

God, or ontology and morals in general, as this ultimate abstraction on the highest level that controls everything else in the lower levels in some ways, and top down processing! 

Higher abstractions are bending the spacetime of lower abstractions in a cortical hiearchy! You merge with god/nature/reality on meditation or psychedelics when those kinds of hiearchies dissolve into hiearchyless attractor where everything influences and synchronizes with everything!

What are your ethics?

Effective buddhahood of internal and external compassion: evaluating beliefs and actions according to calculating an integral of total psychological valence and sustainability of consciousness among time and space

i call my ethics approximate practical utilitariasm such that edge cases and unrealistic scenarios that wouldnt be compatible with the current system that can be mathematically optimal are taken out (plus taking in account the limiting power of the models)

for example if you assume negative utilitarism and some buddhist notions that all concrete life is suffering then the optimal utilitarian move is to get rid of all concrete life to prevent any futher suffering lol

and if suffering is futher generalized by asymmetries in panpsychist framework then the optimal utilitarian move is to theoretically convert the whole universe into zero structure absolutely symmetrical state

more generally if we mathematize psychological valence, it seems that where the line saying this is neutral valence, between positive and negative valence, where its set seems to be arbitrary

if we assume different buddhistic notions (or other framework's notions) where positive valence exists too, then its about maximizing that utility, though in the panpsychist symmetry formalism its again creating as much symmetries in physics as possible

5-MeO-DMT trips or Jhanas that are meditative states are with almost no structure, with the least amount of symmetry breaking in experience, which seems to be measured in the brain as well to a first approximation, and I also dont know any other states of consciousness that feel as good as those assuming the utility we maximize is psychological valence under those formalisms

though pragmatically we need to take in account the whole societal system's all sort of natural laws, game theoretic survivability, ressilience, stability, progression out of bad local minimas and so on

===Effective Collective Wellbeing Engineering===

====Context====

What are the underlying causes of all the problems we are as humanity facing, such as nuclear war to environmental degradation to animal rights issues to class issues, what do these things have in common?

"We have to shift is the economy because perverse economic incentive is under the whole thing, there's no way that as long as you have a for-profit military-industrial complex is the largest block of a global economy that you could ever have peace there's an anti-incentive on it as long as there's so much money to be made with mining, etc., like we have to fix the nature of economic incentives!"

"The core of the thing that we have to address is education because you can have so much change occur in a generation if those children are growing up different as as different as it is learning Chinese is your first language versus learning English we're so neuroplastic by the time we're adults we're not that neuroplastic we're kind of screwed if you get education right we want adults who care about the animals and the oceans and the contend to all of these things and can think complexly if we really get education right we'll be able to solve everything it's upstream from all that!"

"Really the thing is it's about social media because we're continuously being bombarded and we were ready to go do a capital Riot or a George Floyd protester Riot or whatever it is based on the stuff that's coming in if we could change the media environment of what people were in taking it would change all of these things!"

"No the thing is really at the end of the day it's about government and law and how do we get that right because the economic incentive wouldn't be that same issue if we could govern it properly if we could force the internalization of the price of carbon and get carbon pricing properly and get costs of everything proper all that would be fixed but we have to do that through law so how do we fix governance and law!"

"You can't because laws written by lobbyists that get paid for by somebody and wherever the economic motive is what's going to pay for that which is why you  have to think about economics and a lot of the other so the key is political economy and how do you get that!"

"No really the key is actually parenting what we've really got to do is restore the family because before education by the time that kid goes to school at five or six that so much of their identity and psyche and value system has already said it happens early on we have to actually change the entire culture to have parenting emphasize raising better kids from the beginning!"

"Everything you're saying is so anthropocentric the key is the environment because we're none of us are anything without the environment like you have to prioritize that everything else doesn't matter that much and like what is an economy like we can breathe without money we can't breathe without air and so be less anthropocentric and focus on the integrity of the environment because that's upstream from everything!"

unifying languages, cultural compassionate transformation expanding caring cognitive lightcones, mental health reform, antimoloch narratives, (secular?) religion, structure of cities, preparing for climate/economic migrants

The answer to all of the problems is all of the solutions! There is not a theory of change, there's an ecology of theories of change! People can get fundamentalist about their particular solution because if you're working on something you should really care about it but in really caring about it you can become overly narrowly focused. Everything is complexly interacting, there's not a solution, there's lots of things that need to happen! I want patterns of how to think about it, and I want frameworks for how to think about it, I don't want people to attached to those frameworks because they'll be useful but also limiting and to realize the cultural aspects do involve education and media and parenting religion and lots of other things and the structure of cities and you know in the political economy aspects involve lots of things and so getting past the zealotists and reductionist focus and being able to get how do all these things come together is key to understanding properly! [- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v===Kep8Fi_rUUI)

Let's model societal system using the active inference model from complexity science and see different subsystems in our society as different cognitive architectures and different attempts to change as different differently succefull evolutionary pressures on those. How to create the most succesfull evolutionary pressures to steer civilization away from molochian (short term competitive local gain in power at the cost of everyone's long term wellbeing) selfdestruction? 

Moloch is the personification of the forces that coerce competing individuals to take actions which, although locally optimal, ultimately lead to situations where everyone is worse off. Moreover, no individual is able to unilaterally break out of the dynamic. The situation is a bad Nash equilibrium. A trap. https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/moloch

How succesful are the current pressures? Where do we need more impactful solutions? Let's map it out!

for policymakers, economics, governance, climate,...

====Summary====

There is a landscape of crises and (existencial) risks we face, landscape of solutions to them with different degrees of success, all acting as evolutionary forces in the Active Inference model of the global societal system

====Context====

The first outcome of the project will be a unifying map of literature that looks at approaches to identify threats to humanity and how to mitigate them with concrete actions.

It will find similarities and synergies between the approaches, exploring both pessimistic and optimistic perspectives, including making positive future visions real.

Examples of threats are AI risk, bioweapons, climate change, nuclear war, sensemaking and coordination failures, population wellbeing decline, adaptability, meaning and loneliness crisis. 

The results will be contextualized using technical but readable format of science based mathematical Active Inference modeling framework and communicated by articles, videos, online and offline lectures in high impact communities. 

The project will reach out to theoretical and applied researchers, allowing them to find problems to work on, and those working on similar problems to find collaborators, helping to increase the chances of a good future for everyone.

Project goal is to create a science based literature that maps out and bridges different research and applied research communities looking into the problem of existential risks and population wellbeing. It will communicate it in relevant high impact places, leading to more effective global coordination about these problems. The project outcome will serve as a navigation map, connect compatible research groups together, as well as motivate and incentivize groups to advance progress on their respective solutions with supporting research.

====Introduction====

Metaanalysis and synthesis of research literature regarding various approaches to solving the problem of existential risks (including AI risk) and population wellbeing management. 

Using Active Inference and other complementing complex systems mathematical modelling and analysis tools as a concrete technical language to contextualize and synergize various approaches while finding novel solutions.

Map out the space of proposed solutions. Create science based plans to reduce the probability of bad scenarios happening and reduce the probability of extinction if bad scenarios already happen. 

Communicate this research‚Äôs concrete solutions in research community and to places like Effective Altruism to implement the solutions in practice. 

For example how to increase collective rationalism, adaptability, resilience, mental hygiene, connection, coordination by better communication, alignment of biological and artificial agents, or having structures monitor and solve existential risks.

====Goal====

Project goal is to create a science based literature that bridges between different research and applied research communities that are solving the problem of existential risks and wellbeing, and creating new solutions, and communicating it in those places, creating more effective global coordination. If a research or applied research group uses my literature as a navigation map, or if I manage to connect compatible research groups together, or motivate or incentivize a group to advance progress on a solution that is missing (for example missing nuclear fallout shelters), I take that as a win.

1. Summary of risks like artificial intelligence, pandemics, biological or nuclear weapons, nanotechnologies,... and the probability of them causing harm

2. Solutions to preventing above risks such as alignment research, reasonable regulation,... and what to do when they start causing harm such as nuclear fallouts

3. Summary of statistics regarding stuff that is already creating harm such as climate change, pollution, poverty, biodiversity loss, loneliness crisis, teen mental health crisis, financial crises, energy crisis, sensemaking crisis, coordination crisis, meaning crisis,...

4. Solutions to healing the symptoms of above problems such as carbon extraction bioengineering, reducing poverty,... and statistics of them being realized in practice

5. Solutions to healing the sources of above problems such as climate friendly technologies, cooperation,... and statistics of them being realized in practice

6. Put all above information into one map to find potential coordination and collaboration, potentially realtime updating website, where people can add updates?

7. Frame it all in complex systems language in order to make various solutions more science based and show how these problems are interconnected with eachother

8. List of possible futures depending on how all of this will go, from catastrophies to protopias?

9. Communicate the map of various risks to society's survival and flourishing that need more attention in impactful places to incentivize people working on it, online or offline by lectures, articles, videos.

10. When thinking more into the future: Create a an institute with research team monitoring current risks and solutions to them cooperatively on opensource website, framing it in complex systems science language, creating predictions of future, communicating the research in impactful places to incentivize practical application of needed sciencebased solutions

====Abstract====

My project is about tackling the problem of making it as humanity into the future in the most flourishing way. Societal wellbeing, mitigating existencial risks, failure modes, cooperation, flourishing, resilience, adaptivity, sustainable material progress, psychological progress, meaning crisis, polycrisis, metacrisis and so on. I am using the language of information theory, specifically active inference, or more generally Karl Friston's free energy principle, a technical language that can synthetize insights from humanities or mathematical sociology into complex adaptive systems mathematics! I think anything can be grounded in this language!

What influenced me the most? Karl Friston's free energy principle, Bobby Azarian's Universal bayesianism, daniel schmachtenberger's work on the metacrisis, work from qualia research institute, Active Inference community looking into wellbeing, psychology, sociology, collective action, goal alignment, failure modes in unsuccesful modelling and so on

Methodology is incremental learning of big picture languages, then concrete big picture theories inside them and then concrete models and empirical data supporting those

It conveys how societal physics looks like when they're reporting high degree of wellbeing, progress and long term global coordination and sustainability

We have trouble with comprehending the complexity of societal issues. Just like the nervous system isnt disconnected from other systems in the body, or how human individual isnt disconnected from the social system, we don't take in account how everything is very interconnected and influences everything in our modern interconn cted globalized world. We face challenges that Are deeply interconnected in nature. By seeing society as one big information processing modelling adaptive system made or interacting such systems, we can integrate complex dynamics inside one language and make sense of it all more easily. 
By analyzing the current statistics of our issues, such as climate or sensemaking, se can infer where are our weaknesses and heal the symptoms or causes of the issues it generates. We can see how different approaches to solving the meaning, poly and metacrisis can share much in common and how succesful they are in practice.

Some core insights are that we suffer from too much order, too little interconnected systemic thinking, excess of competition, disintegration of social cohesion, too little global coordination, not feeling moral responsibility for all future generations enough, lots of psychopathic active inference agents externalizing harm because of game theoretical short term local benefit

Alternatively: metacrisis is the crisis of perception and understanding that lies within the range of crises humanity faces

Its more complex than everything going wrong using black and white pessimistic lens, there are things so much better in many ways as well, such as reducing poverty, illneses, increasing scientific progress. Some positive effects can in the big picture turn negative though.

======Metacrisis definition======

Underlying crisis driving multitude of overlapping and interconnected global crises - ecological, governmental, economic, financial, geopolitical, energy, cultural, educational, epistemic, psychological, socio-emotional or spiritual crisis

Alternatively: metacrisis is the crisis of perception and understanding that lies within the range of crises humanity faces

Its more complex than everything going wrong using black and white pessimistic lens, there are things so much better in many ways as well, such as reducing poverty, illneses, increasing scientific progress. Some positive effects can in the big picture turn negative though.

Ecological ==== We are hurting out environment that we need for survival.

1. SENSE-MAKING CRISIS (WHAT IS THE CASE?):

‚ÄúConfusion at the level of understanding the nature of the world. Everyday people and experts are struggling to say things that are true, unable to comprehend increasing complexity.‚Äù

Worst-case scenario: ‚Äúcomplete epistemic unmooring and descent into the cultural vertigo of an inescapable simulation.‚Äù

Best-case scenario: ‚Äúemergent forms of post-digital individual and collective sense-making spreading on a massive scale.‚Äù

2. CAPABILITY CRISIS (HOW CAN IT BE DONE?):

‚ÄúIncapacity at the level of operating on the world intelligently. In all social positions and domains of work, individuals are increasingly unable to engage in problem- solving to the degree needed for continued social integration.‚Äù

Worst-case scenario: ‚Äúresults in catastrophic infrastructure failure due to a brain-power shortage.‚Äù

Best-case scenario: ‚Äúrevivification of guilds and technical educational initiatives for a new economics of social system integration.‚Äù

3. LEGITIMACY CRISIS (WHO SHOULD DO IT?):

‚ÄúIncoherence at the level of cultural agreements. Political and bureaucratic forms of power are failing to provide sufficiently convincing rationale and justification for trust in their continued authority.‚Äù

Worst-case scenario: ‚Äúcomplete citizen-level defection from all organised political bodies.‚Äù

Best-case scenario: ‚Äúnew forms of governance and collective choice-making that are built out from first principles, factoring in dynamics that are digital and planetary.‚Äù

4. MEANING CRISIS (WHY DO IT?):

‚ÄúInauthenticity at the level of personal experience. Individuals from all walks of life are questioning the purpose of their existence, the goodness of the world, and the value of ethics, beauty, and truth.‚Äù "Crisis of 'we'"

Worst-case scenario: ‚Äúpeak alienation and a total mental health crisis.‚Äù

Best-case scenario: ‚Äúdemocratisation of enlightenment, sanity and psychological sovereignty.‚Äù

=======Active Inference context=======

Humanity superorganism is a system made out of nested interacting systems (governing parts, social groups), active inference agent preserved by a nested hiearchy/hetearchy/anarchy of markov blankets corresponding to different concrete (governing institution) or abstract (subculture) substructures.   

Sense-making ==== Confusion at the level of understanding the nature of the world. System making for survival and flourishing insufficient models of its internal (understanding how society operates) and external (understanding how nature operates) dynamics by falling into overfitting (too specialized) or underfitting (too general) or freeze responce (not doing anything) failure modes or not having enough computational power to train an accurate representation (unable to comprehend increasing complexity) or not directing modelling power to important areas (ignoring because of short term local interests or just being clueless)

Capability crisis ==== Incapacity at the level of operating on the world intelligently. Not enough coordinated action states to act inside various active inference subagents informed by efficient internal hidden (sense making) states (unable to engage in problem with specific efficient solutions) (solving to the degree needed for continued social integration), not taking in account long term consequences in time (not deep enough policies) or what destructive or maladaptive domino effects (interconnectedness of global crises and influences) (cascading causal influence in the network) it might cause inside or outside the system

Legitimacy crisis ==== Incoherence at the level of cultural agreements. Culture is defined by shared language, when there are asymmetric frameworks of beliefs that when interacting generate inneficient message passing with lots of friction (leading to loss of important information) and inability to reduce uncertainity between governing and laymen clusters of people, result is tension, absence of reinforced dependence and connection (resulting in agents being mutually unsatisfied resulting in mutual distrust)

Meaning crisis ==== Inauthenticity at the level of personal experience. Nonexistent implemented efficient collective scientific (natural sciences) (outside world) and psychological (spiritual) (inside world) uncertainity reduction protocol (metamodern culture of connection) leading to discoordinated local interaction of mutually incompatible disconnected agents with different fundamental priors (science vs spirituality instead of being together, corporations maximizing for limbic hijacking addictivity, corporations not aligned with governing intitutions not aligned with communities of people that are also not connected by something deeper, leading to too much of ingroup outgroup competition (above the healthy limit) instead of collective problem solving as humanity), absence of shared goal space and objective functions, inability to explore uncertain realms because of too much order leading to overfitting (too high mental specialization aka canalization leading to inability to see entropic beauty in everything, being stuck in one's perspective, leading to inability for empathy (psychopathic ethics), inability for theory of mind leading to inability for connection and collective uncertainity reducing goal states, leading to collective hopelessness (brains having action states crisis) and fear about future)


Ecological ==== system (humanity) destroying useful negentropy generator functions in the environment by planning short term instead of long term

====Since Active Inference also works for the brain, where hiearchy of Active Inference agents can be seen as neural populations in the cortical hiearchy, many of these insights come from and can be used for individual mental health engineering as well, strenghtening psychotheraphy systems?====

====More thoughts====

My biggest unknown is: What are the most effective interventions to our system that will a) increase the wellbeing of human population, b) increase collective efficient mitigation and resolving of symptoms and causes of risks and crises and c) making efficient material and psychological (that complement eachother) progress leading to flourishing. And how all those factors interconnect. How to make them respect, support and check eachother instead of fighting violently.

From the perspective of moral responsibility for all current and future generations and looking at current climate reports I would say we need to globally as humanity act more to minimize the acceleration and existing destructive effects of climate change as the current priority (you also have other crisises like mental health, loneliness, energy crisis, overall metacrisis with sensemaking, education etc., or potential risks including nuclear, pandemics, nanoweapons, bioweapons, artificial intelligence (full of lots of perspectives), volcanoes,...). The current coordination doesn't seem to be enough to address the increasing negative climate change statistics and the metacrisis when we look at the current statistics. What are the current core causes of the climate problems? Corporations with big power capital having the most systemic influence maximizing profits short term individually (as in, not caring about the whole humanity), caring just for themselves in polarized competetive dynamics. What are the solutions? What strategies do we have? Spread the message? Fixing symptoms such as carbon extraction from athmosphere, polution extraction, helping biosphere in other ways? Fixing its causes? Make cheaper and better green technologies in science and practice? We can transform the internal structure of the corporations. Use peaceful cooperative dialog in attempt to transform them? Science lecture inside them? Beat them economically by winning over them in competition? Create less psychopathic more compassionate and more globally morally caring corporations winning over them. Make green technologies more economically viable. Use language of money more? Use economical and political pressure on those psychopathic agents. Santions? Altruistic financing? Use civil unrest pressure. Or damage them? Use violence? Or erase them? I understand Eliezer bombing GPU clusters to minimize unaligned AGI risk. Systemic revolution of steering our humanity superorganism away from selftermination with those cancerous cells slowly killing its host From the perspective of moral responsibility for all of humanity, all of current and future generations and looking at current climate reports I would say we need to globally as humanity act more to minimize the acceleration and existing destructive effects of climate change as the current priority (you also have other crisises like mental health, loneliness, energy crisis, overall metacrisis with sensemaking, education etc., or potential risks including nuclear, pandemics, nanoweapons, bioweapons, artificial intelligence (full of lots of perspectives), volcanoes,...).

Or erase them? I understand Eliezer bombing GPU clusters to minimize unaligned AGI risk. Systemic revolution of steering our humanity superorganism away from selftermination with those cancerous cells slowly killing its host into a system not based on such strong psychopathic competetion? Attempt to rebuild society on collective meaning? But would that be enough force to stop the current strongest cancerous power structures screwing it up for everyone? Strenghten regulations? Strenghten global top down governance such as United Nations? That will create civil unrest from the psychopathic people and corperations (which already happens a lot), but if language of cooperation and peaceful dialog isnt enough, what then is enough? Are AI technologies accelerating it even more? Certain degree of competetion and arms races is evolutionary good and has certain advantages, like technological innovation, but too much of it leads us to those multipolar traps. Is peace enough? Is violence needed? Could violence lead to accelerated selftermination and disconnection instead of cultivation of culture of connection and harmony and resolving conflicting parts not aligned with the collective wellbeing? We dont want opression like in Russia, or chaos like in Somalia, we want something third that benefits the longterm wellbeing of humanity! Strong education about all of this? Culture of compassion and connection? Liquid democracy? Communes? Degrowth? What are other possible strategies? What are the most optimal combinations of those strategies to create the chances of the most efficient collective long term wellbeing, survival and flourishing? All of attempts individually add up into one giant force of care for all current and future generations! I believe we will succeed when we join forces together effectively!

Raw capitalism creates an evolutionary pressure/incentive/objective function of raw profits, incentives that go against what feels good to most people. Money on money dynamics even more. You can use top down restrictions to maximize chances of collective survival, increase collective long term wellbeing and meaning, but its not given that governing structure will be aligned with values of people, wellbeing etc., so it needs to be checked via for example multiple governing structures or ideally by democracy. To avoid lots of meaning and wellbeing and theory of governance issues when electing, we need education of people in those issues, not being stuck in one world view with focused attention, aligning values of the governing parts with the layman compatible with wellbeing/risks science. Power check and reduce psychopathic agents by culture of connection and compassion? Gene editing to enhance compassion? Can laymen people even be systematically thaught these complex topics, is that realistic? Or is the only solution some strong enough evolutionary pressure on the structue of the system from wellbeing, existencial risk, etc. scientists? Some kind or technocracy? That needs power and corruption checking too. How to approximately evaluate expertise to minimize psychopathic agents? Some academic system that isnt as broken as current academic system? And who checks that? Some metascientists/metagovernaning structures? Who checks that? Do we need antimoloch God under everything tonescape this loop? How to avoid psychopathic evolutionary pressures? Is centralized power fundamentally doomed? Degrowth? Decentralized independent donbar number communes only? Does that halt collective action against for example climate change? How to prevent tribal wars? Is that even possible with current total interdependence? Does current system halt efficient collective action as well? Somewhere yes in some problems (EU climate) somewhere not (USA) (collective sensemaking and wellbeing), but not globally, and we have the metacrisis. Can gametheoretically stable "ideal" system equivalent to benevolent illuminati Gods controling everything for long term survival and wellbeing of the people even exist? There is also issue of plurality of existing moral/ethical etc. systems. Respect or try to reform those dynamics or some middle way? There is also the issue of plurality of models of wellbeing and risks and that also come from plularity of values. Can we synthetize them? Create evolutionary selection dynamics between them measured by their success? Minimize friction between them in an ecosystem where they interact? How about plurality of methods quantifying and measuring success? All this prediction and measuring stuff also takes tons of computational power and complexity that might be incomprehensible, we must approximate and select various comprehensible factors like in climate science. What are the best approximator factors to look for in the system? We're back at the issue of plurality. If we go from theory back to practice and editing what we already have, how to create the most efficient set of evolutionary pressures to steer the current system's structure more towards wellbeing and risk mitigation? Strengthten effective altruism education and influence?

Excess of competition/rivarly and order is behind the metacrisis?

Different people speak with different fundamental languages determining their actions so if one wants to change their action one should synchronize with their objective functions. Politics is a lot about the language of power. Corporations speak the language of money. Language of values. Language of morality. Language of meaningful experiences and meaning in general. Supercooperators are the golden nugget against the metacrisis. What are the best evolutionary pressures for supercooperation clusters? Compassion, psychedelics, meditation, unity, opposite of polarization, nonduality? Could massemailing people that have the biggest causal influence in determining humanity's trajectory while synchronizing as most as possible with their language lead to efficient evolutionary pressure towards a good third attractor? What else is needed to make strong enough good evolutionary pressure in the evolution of societal architecture?

The current economic system was a solution to no wars happening after WW2, where growth was not mediated by war but by exponentially growing GDP of economies, which might be breaking now with exponential extraction of resources that replenish linearly and Russia is under such pressure which results in it attacking Ukraine. If we assume all nations want to fundamentally expontentially grow by GDP, technology, resources and other means, and if physically nonviolent ways of growing are not an option anymore, they use war to conquer and grow, is this Russia's current state? Would financially helping them instead of sanctions paradoxically help the war other than accelerate? Or would it accelerate as their tense hatred of EU/USA etc. and need for annihilation could be used realized more efficiently? Or are sanctions strong enough to kill all their power to conquer?

Human intelligence not being bound by wisdom, where wisdom is seeing and setting goals and acting from the point of wholeness (planetary collective moral awareness) instead of from the point of parts, is the core driver of metacrisis we are facing.

Ideal capitalism (which doesnt exist) maximizes by default short term profit of comodities (tree is valued by how much you get from extracting it) which goes against longtermist goals so regulations (like carbon tax or AI regulation) try to fix those loop holes to direct it correctly, but this is trying to fix the symptoms of the inherent economic system, and we could maybe instead try to redesign the economic system from first principles that things are valued holistically (tree is part of ecosystem that when cut down casacades to climate change related food scarsities), could system ran on AI do this?

Activism and lobbying into good actors in this hiearhical process to make destructive actions or actions with externalities less profitable and morally right to make economic incentive for the right kinds of actions in terms of minimizing Molochian dynamics. Closing the unsustainable loops inside economy that lead to pollution. Trees maintain the ecosystem's soil, many things live there, it interacts with water sources etc. and we dont even fully know how it works and by lumber extraction we get marginal local game theoretic advantage but potentially millions of dollars in terms of damage in the long term in terms of floods and extreme weather events or droughts or general ecosystem loss that we dont tend to factor, we affect suff that is in the unknown set that we cant fully measure because of its big interconnectivity and complexity and predictively chaotic behavior. 
Overall biological systems do holistic interconnected computations across scales that evolutionarily evovled by tons of natural selection and thats why they're so good at computing and plastic and unpredictable while our artificial machines predictively exploit just mostly one scale and one type of computation.

Multiple agents in the same environment minimizing uncertainity with objective functions reducable to basic needs, aligned or misaligned with the collective, we need alignment

Compassion as way of unifying them

Realization of shared basic needs and values as unifying them by rituals created by leaders

Trabsformation of inner strcture of power structures (corporations) that go cancerous

Forming of noncancerous corporations

Forming of noncancerous education and ability to grasp incresed complexity with metamodernism and AI

Tracking cancerous processes and transforming them

Transform psychopathic economic incentives to altruistic ones, emergent through culture of connection instead of division, training cleaning the mind from parasiging processes and connection to diffusion attention? 

direct problem: rivalious dynamics

solution: changing the generation function by fusing with cultural eastern enlightenment by maximizing compassion which minimizes agents gain short term local profit instead of long term global profit (in terms of survival, flourishing, wellbeing)?

direct problem as a consequence:

existing agents benefiting themselves short term instead of long term for everyone driving climate change and exponential social media addictive tech destroying mental health meaning and so on

The answer to all of the problems is all of the solutions, I believe many solutions should to be more deployed synergetically more than the current attempts to make collective survival and flourishing more probable. I'm deeply optimistic the collective efforts across solutions will be enough, which is both optimistic prediction and fueling motivation for changing stuff for the better, as the opposite counterfactual implies hopelessness and doom and decreases chances of things actually getting better if people have that belief. Collective beliefs are both predicting and forming the future. 

Good future will happen! Darwinian bonds will be transcended. Consciousness will flourish. QRI is the key player for reverseengineering consciousness. There will be infinite bliss gradients in game theoretically stable system undestroyable by petrubations. Let's make this happen collectively. Reverseengineering consciousness and universe. Beating Replicators. Beating Moloch. Optimism is not only justified, it's a fight for a higher future.

Force the change of their internal workings

Create new ones that outcompete them, or merge with them through cooperation and make them less psychopathic (competition leads to psychopathy tho)

What do we want? Reduce uncertainity about our basic needs and (evolutionary pressured by nature plus nurture) learned goals driven by values (minimize Active Inference agent's free energy (decrease dissonance) of objective functions pretrained by evolution or culture or individual inquiry in interconnected societal system). Evolution pretrained us to automatically depend on others in family, community, culture, nation state etc. That's broken by genes correlating with psychopathy combined with environmental influences such as for example pollution, inflamation, or depending uncertainity minimizing mutual agent to agent bond being unsuccesful and thus breaking, leading to feeling hurt and cascading trust issues leading to asymmetries and rivalious dynamics and isolation and alienation and individualization of the agent or clusters of agents in their social graph in relation to mimimizing uncertainity about basic needs, leading to loneliness and dissolution of motivation for collective synchronized sensemaking and shared goals to survive and flourish collectively, which can is fixable by strong enough evidence that bonding is worth it to satisfy basic needs and goals collectively by compatible language or action. Leaders do collective uncertainity reduction this at scale.

How to fix any problem:

Locate and name maladative symtoms (surface processes) and the core generating functions (cause) those symtoms.

Find and apply methods of fixing both symtoms and the core generator functions such that collapse of the system's stability doesn't happen by mathematical theory's derivation from the system's laws (regularities in time) or by experimenting.

Spread solutions throught the system by efficient massage passing and incetivize parts to cooperate on solving this problem. 

In the spacial case of the meaning crisis - Find what you're best at: theoretical research, practical research in different scientific fields, engineering, accounting, working with people, spreading solutions - and do that, ideally do what isnt done enough yet, where work towards survival and flourishing is missing.

Succesful leaders install local and global objective functions into agents, giving oportunities for pleasant error reduction gradients, creating goal alignment, resolving power or belief asymmetries that lead to conflicts via finding common ground, make efficient selforganization

We need more efficient leaders reducing population's uncertainity by speech with realistic models and incentivizing people to actions that increase collective chances of survival and future flourishing, giving people sense of meaning and sense of connectedness with the collective

Many leaders with slightly different fundamental assumptions emerge, but with the same intention of unifying people to survive and flourish. Could metaleaders aligning existing leader's languages help?

Could the underlying crisis of metacrisis be interpreted as valence crisis as a sign of dying humanity superorganism? Possibly too pesimistic interpretation. More like tons of before differianted human superorganisms attempting to merge together as their markov blanket boundaries dissolve together thanks to the internet, will we do it succesfully? Are we witnessing the statistical merging of Europe, then merging of Europe with America and rest of the world, is China succesfully stable markov blanket on its own? 

We need optimal amount of both cooperative generalists and competing specialists in society

I doubt genetic profile has changed, let's look into environmental factors. A lot of people report not being satisfied with their job, not seeing meaning in it, such as for example soul numbing corporate jobs, living from paycheck to paycheck. We need to feel connected to the collective and feel like we're doing good for it. This is the loneliness/interconnectedness crisis. We must cultivate a culture of connection to fix this. There are so many asymmetries in cultural dynamics killing this. Instead of making money for overly rich boss that's not altruistic, we wanna feel like adding value to our ingroup directly.

Radical going to the deepest source of any problem possible combined with radical empathy seems to be the best kind of problem solving method. Sometimes you can only heal symptoms, sometimes its too late, sometimes you can change whole future iterations of the system by changing its deepest pattern generator functions.

I think many of the individual solutions to the metacrisis can be modelled as fundamental and everything downstream from that, many thinkers ended up with that in their model, but I think they're all partial. I tend to be often on the side that education is one of the strongest factors that should be enhanced and many things downstream from it. There are many methods to achieve that for example, I'm slowly mapping them out. You can try to get people with lots of power on your side (those that have causal power over how education is realized) for example and try to speak as much as possible their language and incetivize positive change via dialog, money, contribution etc. 
Or for example if you have wealthy people or government destroying rainforests, here you can talk their language by appealing to the fact that it kills climate and ecosystems leading to crop failures leading to food scarity leading to internal instability of angry people thats hard to govern and costs lots of money.
I would say its about finding where you have the highest chances, as an individual, or as a collective. Many movements are attempting to do the many reforms already, so supporting those, finding what actors are more likely to get on your side, etc. Science communication about these problems.
Some friction will almost always happen. I would say it's about minimizing it. Sometimes only confrontation prevents long term harm. Sometimes too much confrontation can be counterproductive instead. Being too radical might end up damaging somewhere, but might be good somewhere. Depends a lot on the current problem space I would argue. 
Some issues with deep roots will probably need much more radical changes, I agree. Redesigning how current money mechanism and its physics works by changing it into something different that doesnt generate as much perverse incentives by for example less reductivity - that would require lots of big changes. 
I would argue it all lives on a spectrum. From changing slightly what is to extreme changes. I would say its about finding what is the best middle way.
I believe current dynamics will be changed by all the various movements attempting to change for the better on this spectrum. 
As an individual I attempt to be as effective agent as possible by so far mostly learning about all these things and communicating them and I want to do more educating. I am/plan to join more forces with various other people attempting to help all of this. I wish one person could help all of it at the same time, but that's impossible. Strenghtening collective effort in all the various problem landscapes is big part of it. Hopefully the collective acceleration will in good direction and strong enough. I can do only so much as one agent that is attempting to help this. Attempt at (automated?) mass education is one way. 
There are various analysis methods for calculating how impactful your intervention can be from Effective Altruism etc. [Four modes of thinking about cause prioritization | by Jakub Simek | Giving On The Edge | Medium]([Four modes of thinking about cause prioritization | by Jakub Simek | Giving On The Edge | Medium]([Four modes of thinking about cause prioritization | by Jakub Simek | Giving On The Edge | Medium](https://medium.com/giving-on-the-edge/four-modes-of-thinking-about-cause-prioritization-8b9f81abd6b0)))

‚ÄúA society can be viewed as a superorganism that expresses an intrinsic purpose of achieving and maintaining vitality. The systems of a society can be viewed as a societal cognitive architecture. The goal of the R&D program is to develop new, integrated systems that better facilitate societal cognition (i.e., learning, decision making, and adaptation). Our major unsolved problems, like climate change and biodiversity loss, can be viewed as symptoms of dysfunctional or maladaptive societal cognition. To better solve these problems, and to flourish far into the future, we can implement systems that are designed from the ground up to facilitate healthy societal cognition.
The proposed R&D project represents a partnership between the global science community, interested local communities, and other interested parties. In concept, new systems are field tested and implemented in local communities via a special kind of civic club. Participation in a club is voluntary, and only a small number of individuals (roughly, 1,000) is needed to start a club. No legislative approval is required in most democratic nations. Clubs are designed to grow in size and replicate to new locations exponentially fast‚Äù

"Of course, most people are not like "I know how to change a hundred trillion dollar a day global postWW2 nuclear weapon Bretton Woods market system that is advancing at exponential speed with aritifical intelligence." but "I just wanna know how to fucking feel better in this world.". Issue is that in "I don't understand what is making me feel the way I do, I just want to feel better." we think of us as separate from everything, which is one of the core drivers that fucks everything up. There is no psychological health where I don't recognize my interconnectedness with all that my life depends on, ultimately I'm in service of that." 

There's no me, there's only we. Open individualism. Connection valence crisis.

===Meaning and Metacrisis===

Valence (internal and external attraction) crisis seems to in general be solved by some interconnecting memeplex on both individual and local level or all the other factors in equation of happiness. "Everything is made, comes from God, awareness." Any common beliefs, goals, values, ideology, philosophy, language, meaning,... it's about destressing the individualist local structures and stressing collective global structures until they're stressless dissolved unified baseline. Everything else in the happiness equation holds as well.

Solving the metacrisis by emergent coherent symmetrically distributed and governing societal values as high level priors of civilizational hyperorganism emergent from democratic power checking through education binding exponential tech and other potential existencial risks increasing adaptibility, coordination, unity, wellbeing of people? [The Dark Side of Conscious Ai | Daniel Schmachtenberger - YouTube]([The Dark Side of Conscious Ai | Daniel Schmachtenberger - YouTube]([The Dark Side of Conscious Ai | Daniel Schmachtenberger - YouTube]([The Dark Side of Conscious Ai | Daniel Schmachtenberger - YouTube]([The Dark Side of Conscious Ai | Daniel Schmachtenberger - YouTube]([The Dark Side of Conscious Ai | Daniel Schmachtenberger - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7WtcTATa2U)))))) Is the absence of unifying misaligned collective values and goals top down fundamental bayesian prios a sign of pathological disintegration of a hyperorganism?

Moloch dynamics. https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/ I think this kind of mathematical dynamics can be applied scalefree in society and the mind. Psychopathologies can be seen as maladaptive nash equilibrium configurations of subagents. For example small perturbations can easily create tons of error signals in the system, putting it under stress which can unify it or destabilize it. Or trade off between freedom and governance, competition and cooperation. I care about both scales about everyone.

The problem with economy creating incentives that dont benefit wellbeing or longterm flourishing and multipolar traps is that you get competetive evolutionary arms races, exponentially growing compoundong interest in linear resource economy, physics of money making on money on money up to infinitum. This is unrealiable in long term. Exponentially growing economy was the solution to wars over resources moving from physical to economic scale. To sidestep resource scarity, silicon valley attempts to solve it by creating monetary value on software, but even that is limited as hardware and human attention is limited and wont grow infinitely. Attempting to redirect this towards an better nash equilibrium with more adaptibility to existencial risks and wellbeing of people without discoordinated competetive anarchy (too much freedom) or totalitiriam regime (too much control), but a third attractor, is hard.

Another big factor is to create intersystemic trust via steelmanning of values and satisfying as much parties as possible to diffuse tension and minimize friction to increase cooperation between clusters of agents and maximize alignment on the most fundamental level possible. (AIs joining the mix - use LLMs to understand LLMs is the most plausible method currently?)

More bio/cyber/etc. weapons (synthbio, AI,...) that might be as destructive as atomic bombs that might be even easier to make or control or monitor by open science and so on might be a bit of an issue.

Because world today is so interconnected and interdependant than before, destabilizing in one part of the world can effect the whole world for example economically. Climate change also effects everyone. Many of the risks are interconnected and there might be domino effects. Slightly more extreme weather killing crops creating mass economic migration putting stable countries under economic and cultural adaptibility load.

There will be always something underterminite when modelling and predicting a system, let it be quantum uncertainity, chaotic dynamics, the fact that we always approximate, or the fact that in order to model some systems we would need to simulate its evolution fully

We could maybe test what is needed for consciousness by slowly cutting off or replacing parts of the body and its systems to find out where the boundary is between conscious system and nonconscious system. Problem is pzombies or panpsychist assumptions assume that even an electron is conscious lol, so probably just the subject might know.

If the imposed dynamics imply better overall wellbeing of people and better global adaptibility to existencial risks, thats more positive sum for all to me. There are societies today or societies in the past that were more adapted or more well than others. It is determined by both internal and external factors.

Regulating climate change or AI has to be global because there are arms races and opponents that externalize costs to get local short term advantage at the cost of global long term get evolutionary advantage.

Meme complexes or organisms in general that evolutionary game theoretically win are those who dominate, convert, risk assert themselves as the only true one, such as Christian crusades, Alexander the great (or democracy is internally asserted as only good one) or China, where nonviolent Tibet is a failing strategy when it comes to survival.

Separation of power (market, church, state (legislature, executive, judiciary)) as an implementation of checks and balances as an immunity to prevent dystopian power monopoly and asymmetric dynamics. Hard to implement it long term in changing landscape of internal and external coniditons that needs to be adapted to and people forget why revolutions happened to destroy past power monopolies so they stop inhabiting asymmetric potentials through checks and balances of power structures and they start fusing into power monopolies plus sociopaths having evolutionary advantage. 

Civilization can be analyzed in three ways that interconnectedly interact and influence eachother by interforming: what is its a memeplex (world views, value systems, what ought to be) (computational), social coordination strategies (behavior, financial incentives) (algorithmic) and physical tooling set upon it depends (tech) (implementational). What changes in all three od them simultaneously, factoring all the feedback loops, produce a virtuos cycle that orients in a direction that isnt dystopias (Chinalike top down agent imposing (opressive) goals and values on people instead of them being emergent from the values of people getting into the government using democracy) or catastrophies (zero governance, zero power checking, asymmetrical competetion of everyone, anarchocapitalism, bezos empire versus zuckerberg empire, zero top down agent) ? Cumulative exponential tech level is currently the most dominant and binding all other levels instead of the other way around. We need values of the people to bind tech instead. Those values can be elected into governance via will of the people via democracy with checking and balances of power from the people and by separation of power, preventing opression, tyranny and dystopias, creating aligned emergent instead of imposed values, by educating people both scientifically and morally and theory of governance, such that collective will of the people isnt dumb and misguided to govern exponential tech and selfterminate creating catastrophies but instead bind it for long term adaptive wellbeing by thinking about its nth order effects without big narrow techno pessimist or techno optimist bias universally globally to prevent arms races to not selfterminate the whole world by multipolar traps. Unity via less narrower more connected through more fundamental similarities value systems preventing stuff like left right polarization. For example people of US have small power on power checking the economical power.

I wanna experience all beings feeling peace, safety, satisfaction, selfrealization, belonging, acceptance, being understood, freedom, happiness, contentment!

==Metacrisis, moloch==

==Love and transcendence==

Identity shift to groundless ground is very useful as it minimizes fear or not feeling home when dissolving the generative model's evolutionary useful structures to feel more free. The less you fundamentally identify with some concrete cluster of sensations, the less things will bother you. Mental frameworks are configurations of the qualia that make the new insights stick. Groundless ground makes all nondual dissolving realizations stick permanently, makin them not just an experience that instantly fades away. The more one pushes himself in this framework, the more it stick. Constantly integrating emptiness into form. Mundane things become divine. Being "out of simulation" becomes the same as being "trapped inside simulation". Nirvana becomes samsara. Duality becomes nonduality. Distinction becomes unity. Somewhat something moving on a fading road. Experience without projector. The screen of consciousness isn't fundamental too. No ground. Freedom. Pure love.

==Context, who is this book for?==

- My motivation behind everything is to help people have more fullfilling life, have better sense of wellbeing, using what we know from theory and empirical studies of practices in science. This book is from the depth of my caring heart for:

- '''People looking to enhance their wellbeing or the wellbeing of others''' and live life to the fullest as we all want such as psychotherapists, meditators, or psychonauts: I try to create an equation for individual and collective happiness, I look into what genetic and environmental (nature and nurture) factors determine wellbeing, what can we do to engineer it, how wellbeing looks like in the brain using many lenses, from adaptively predictively resolving uncertainity about basic needs to having sense of direction and (ideally collective) meaning and motivation in life to frictionless cooperating consonant symmetrical brain regions and subagents as a single unit like a family to engineering it using tools from psychotheraphy, spirituality, philosophy, meditation, substances, biotechnology, ways of seeing the world give the most wellbeing, from falling in love with the mystery of reality and everyone and everything to groundless ground full of peace and freedom, by symmetrifications using annealing!

- '''Science nerds, interdisciplionary/transdisciplinary scientists''', people looking for a general technical language that can conceptualize by steelmanning any predictive models in natural sciences or everyday life in general and synthetize them into an even better predictive model: I lay out a language to evaluate how good any predictive model in natural sciences across scales and levels of analysis is, using the free energy principle and complex adaptive dynamical systems theory in general!

- '''Neuroscientists, neurophenomenologists, psychologists, psychotherapists''': I unify various used approaches of analyzing the brain, experience, environment and actions together into a single framework, how to get people from maladaptive configurations that doesnt support happiness, how trauma healing by healing parts of the mind by showing them love using internal family systems or coherence theraphy might work in the software and hardware, from bayesian belief networks to connectome harmonics!

- '''People looking for hope with dealing with poor mental heath, people lost on their spiritual path in the dark night of the soul''': I look into how psychodiscomfort may work in the brain and into various approaches of healing it, from maladaptively interconnected brain regions to maladaptive beliefs, from dissonance, oscillopathy, or asymmetries to feeling hopeless from failing to reduce uncertainity about basic needs to feeling anxious from overly interconnected emotional brain to disconnected noncooperating parts of the mind!

- '''People looking for hope for the future of the humanity when it comes to its survival and wellbeing''': I look into how to solve the meaning (wellbeing) and meta crisis disguised as valence (unity) crisis on local and collective scales by cooperately reducing the probabilities of the various existencial risks such as mental health crisis, nuclear war, climate change, economic collapse or misaligned artificial general superintelligence. I focus on how to possibly cultivate trust and frictionless symmetrical cooperative communication between different subagents with different mental frameworks, such as people, machines, communities, cities, governing parts in nations, nations, by for example the language of shared meaning, values and goals, as natural sciences tell us that we're all part of one interconnected system where parts depend on eachother and we should take in account the whole when solving a problem, and using insights from wellbeing science from for example complex systemic mechanisms of internal family systems psychotheraphy, how to unify the human population in general to feel more connected and be adaptive together, how to increase wellbeing in the society on the collective scale using symmetrification though annealing, having an ecosystem of interacting cooperative aethetics that are part of high degree of collective harmonious wellbeing! I look into how to beat Moloch.

- '''Physicists''': I think about the quest for a unified theory of everything in physics and beyond in natural sciences: What are the advantages and disadvantages of different predictive mathematical models, how to reason about it on a metalevel to find a model with the most advantages

- '''Philosophers''': I ponder on questions like what is truth using the general technical language of bayesian mental constructions in a certain lens, I think about formal systems to describe any system 

- I think about wellbeing locally on the individual level, I'm looking for and developing theory and practical applications explaining why and how for example substance assisted psychotheraphies, selfimprovement movements, meditation, or neurorotechnology works. 

- I think about wellbeing globally on the collective, what science of wellbeing tells us, why and how societies that report better quality of life report it, what all factors in the social system come into play, and how could society be practically pushed towards that better more adaptive state. 

- I conceptualize everything in natural sciences and experience through the mathematics of adaptive complex systems. I am interested in those mathematics to engineer wellbeing on all scales and find correspondences between different scientific disciplines and different approaches inside concrete scientific disciplines. 

- I think that everything in psychotheraphy, psychology, sociology, selfimprovement, spirituality, biology, physics, neuroscience, cognitive science, and so on, can be understood and interconnected through this general mathematical language of adaptive complex systems. 

- I think this general language can sketch out new potential wellbeing engineering interventions on both local and global scale, and then can be translated into the less mathematical language or less general language of laymen cultural frameworks, psychology, sociology, spirituality, biology, cognitive science, and so on. 

- I first do a giant general synethesis and then dig deeper into concrete details.

This is what I'm developing in this book.

==Abstract==

'''For science nerds and hyperphilosophical beings:'''

- I map out possible philosophical assumption, models of physics, I use scalefree information theory a lot, I map out science of consciousness, wellbeing, sociology, approaches to predicting the future and to existencial risks. I formulate a theory of every "thing" using quantum nonequilibrium thermodynamics framed in quantum information theory using quantum formulation of the free energy principle with quantum darwinism. I note important concepts such as symmetries and annealing as tools to analyze and engineer how healthy an ecosystem such as mind or society is in a mapped out landscape of complex system research with focus on in consciousness and societal research with focus on local and global wellbeing and adaptibility to the landscape of existencial risks and beating moloch

'''For meditators and psychonauts:'''

- I explain how one can put into language everything in experience, how to effectively engineer wellbeing, how to heal, how to achieve new levels of freedom or depth in experience, through deconstructive and reconstructive meditation, psychedelics or philosophy.

'''For everyone:'''

==Less abstract abstract==

I start with context: Hell must be destroyed! üíñüò∏ My motivation behind everything is to help people have more fullfilling life, have better sense of wellbeing, using what we know from theory and empirical studies of practices in science.

The whole text is an attempt to find, explain, synthesize all tools used for wellbeing engineering on individual and social scale to help everyone the most effectively, mapping out the landscape in science and psychotools

First I do a synthesis of individually used wellbeing psychotools in less technical language without explaining mechanisms (because I havent introduced science yet). Deconstruction of mind, inducing happiness, construction, shifting to more relaxed, deeper, healed, loving, light, spontanious, fullfilling, free baseline (symmetrification accelerationism!), by meditation and psychedelics, with lots of inspiration from Michael Taft and Shinzen Young, or potentially neurotechnology in the future. 

Then I do synthesis of science, connecting the landscape of neurophenomenological approaches together (implementational modelling of populations of neurons, resonance chamber, electromagnetism physics, connectivity of large networks), algorithmic (machine learning architectures), computational (markov blankets, , reinforcement learning agents,  evolution of latent bioelectrical morphologocal spaces), phenomenological (pragmatic dharma, solitons in a field, flow of energy, beliefs, words, images, feelings in spacetime etc.), connecting social science approaches together, in the context of universal darwinian bayesianism based on the free energy principle with potentially quantumness taken into account, and present the general symmetry analysis and annealing principles as tools that can be used in analysis of any complex system, and how symmetries tend to correspond more wellbeing of the system, making it more flexibly adaptive, but too much symmetries can also be a failure mode because of not being able to resist entropy. Annealing is presented as a tool to symmetrify the system's dynamics through disintegration of local nonlinearities and creation of more global synchrony.

Then in the framework of connecting (not only) qualia research institute ideas with bayesian brain ideas I give some technical notes to the synthesis of individual psychotools I mapped out before, mapping out the empirically tested or hypothesized mechanisms of action.

I think about some fundamental philosophical questions of ontology and truth and how it can be seen through a very mental model (bayesian belief) relativist lens, inspired by metarationality and metamodernism - caring about predictive power of models, them not being fully objective but just approximations, and how much valence they give (unifying memeplexes increase wellbeing by application of symmetry theory of valence to bayesian belief networks)

Then after all this synethesis, I create a landscape of explained concepts concretely in this synthetized framework linking to more research in the landscape of research out there in more detail, creating a tree to navigate, instead all of it being meshed in one text, writing an explanation for both laymen and technical people

Main concepts explained so far would be: psychology (self, meaning, happiness, trauma, values, agency, emotions, neurodiscomfort, neurodivergences), substances (psychedelics, dissociatives, antidepressants), psychotheraphy (cognitive behavioral theraphy, internal family systems, mindfullness, acceptance theraphy, psychedelics assisted psychotheraphy, Gestalt), meditation (deconstruction, construction, do nothing, love and kindness, jhanas, cessations, deities, DMT entities, gods, insight, dark night of the soul), sociology (wellbeing and meaning in society, coordinating risks, adaptibility), neurotechnology (relaxing focusing neurohelmets, deep brain stimulation)

Also not forgetting to explain üíñLoveüò∏!

Then some other concepts:
nostalgia, intelligence, stimulants, weed, alcohol, sex, music, chakras without metaphysical assumptions, lucid dreaming, other neurotechnology
And some of my other thoughts on AGI alignment, unifying physics, and some other ideas or philosophical stuff that's in my mind

I end it with personal message about my journey, how I got here, what kind of my past motivates me to do this stuff.

Nice aethetics for everyone! Loving caring vast spacious silent infinite free full of life joyous cute colorful spontaneous divine compassionate flowy aethetics for everyone! I map out the aethetics I've acquired over the years. üíñüò∏ I'll maybe also add a story about crazy scientist travelling the statespace of existence (multiverse?) giving all beings in all multiverses infinite gradients of wellbeing. üíñüò∏

==In simple terms: How does experience work? How can we heal discomfort, learn effectively, have fun, or be happy?==

===Mechanisms of experience===

The image above includes it all. Let‚Äôs start from the beginning.

What is the only thing we can be certain about? What seems like the only fundamental truth? There is currently some kind of experience happening. Let‚Äôs look into it. This is a model I like the most: There is a 3D world that changes as time passes. It has an outside and inside world. We can see that by vision. There are also sounds coming from inside and outside. Then in experience we can have sense of our body when we scan it, getting messages from the body, and also touch, taste and smell. We have thoughts made of language, visual thoughts and feelings. We can experience raw senses or our concept, our image of them. We have a sense of us in the center, and sense of others and the world. All of that is inside (and made of) awareness. We can pay attention to one or more things, observe, and manipulate them. 

That is exactly the yellow lines on the picture. What does the picture represent? To put it simply, orange blobs are neurons, that find patterns, compress incoming data, and learn to respond to their environment. Brown lines are connections between the neurons. What are the yellow lines? Thats exactly what I started with ‚Äì Our unified conscious experience, it's like an operating system that is running at all times and gets turned off in deep sleep. Our internal world simulation that we construct to make sense of the internal and external world. When the operating system is on, from the sides come requested memories, signals what to pay attention to, what is valued, and also raw sensations. What comes out is actions to think a memory, redirect the mind or move the body in the external world. Those are the blue waves. 

What happens when the blue brain waves, aka sensations, interact with our experience? Our experience finds out if its supposted to be there ‚Äì how surprising it is. If its not surprising, we go on about our day. If we suddenly see a giant rainbow fluffy unicorn hugging us, that might be slightly surprising! The surprise can feel bad or also good. As a consequence, we shift our expectations that encountering such unicorn isn‚Äôt as unlikely!

===Happiness===

How does happiness work? When does experience feel pleasant? When it does not feel blocked. When we‚Äôre in a smooth flow state of life. When we can live life to the fullest! When our basic needs are satisfied. When we selfactualize. When we can do things that make us happy. When we don‚Äôt feel stuck, when we feel free, when we can grow. When we can just stresslessly be and relax. When things are going as we assume. When we love what is. When we can easily adapt. When our values are satisfied. When there isn‚Äôt sense of something being wrong. When our internal parts are communicating with other parts and are not isolated. When there are no hurts parts from trauma, panicking anxious parts from uncertainity, or depresed parts giving up from thinking that they are unsuccesful. When everything feels in harmony, generating sense of meaning and being satisfied with current experience. Take care of happiness and meaning will take care of itself. Love is the existencial stance with reality, way of commiting yourself to a partiular connection in the outer or inner world. Meaning is the sense of interconnectedness with us, others and the world and overall everything.

===Meditation===

When we meditate, we can observe and have insight about the the details of our experience. We can notice everything that I‚Äôve written so far. We can learn to be more mindful of experience. We can focus on breath and relax the thinking mind this way. We can just observe thoughts come and go without being them or interfering with them. We can see the mental constructedness of the self, of our personality and identity, of our likes and dislikes. We can calm down panicking parts by acceptance. We can heal spiky hurt parts with love. We can transform or deepen or interconnect our beliefs and knowledge by pondering or letting the automatic subconscious mind do it for us. We can reduce our uncertainity about us and the world. We can energize an imagined mental construct by meditating on it, such as healing light or buddha of compassion. We can cultivate interconnectedness and selflove, love for others or everything there is by sending love and kindness. We can align how we interpret, and what we do now and in everyday life, with our goals and higher meaning. We can cultivate sense of transcendental meaning. We can dissolve the fear of death by realistically imagining that you're dying.

===Deconstruction and reconstruction===

We can energize the background of the whole awareness with chanting or doing nothing. We can quiet the conceptual thinking mind and dissolve and unify all the distinct senses into pure nothingness, into pure expanded awareness, into pure void and love, when we let go and see the mental constructedness of concepts, thoughts, sensations, and everything, when we dissolve sense of time, space, center, boundary, directions, and attention trying to grab sensations by letting go of the sense of doer and experiencer, even sense of there being an awareness, or sense of any being at all, sense of existing and there being some existence, letting everything unfold without blockages, friction, inteference, by surrendering, by noticing the whole senses at once, by noticing everything's thinness, lightness, expansiveness beyond the constructed boundary, by noticing the vast still quiet spacious light effortless boundaryless centerless nonjugmental indestructible loving caring qualities of infinite awareness that is like space. This is all extremely pleasant and free, as it‚Äôs just raw uninterrupted flow not judged by any stressed conceptual contractions. Even perception, consciousness itself can turn off. 5-MeO-DMT also dissolves and unifies all senses into flow of oneness. The depthness of the deepest defabricated experiences "one" can experience transcends everything that he has ever been doing until then in terms of meaning as it feels full of total complete global infinite eternal meaning full of mystery, awe, connection, comfort, home, love. This sense of unity, sense of deep refreshing, can be achieved via other activities too, such as dancing, singing, playing an instrument, excercising, doing sport, nondual philosophy, message, sauna, sex, praying ‚Äì many possibilities! The advatages of meditation is that it can cultivate sense of unconditional freedom, unity, love, stressfreeness and happiness that is stable in any conditions. After dissolving our whole internal world simulation, when the operating system is staring again, we can play with our deepest assumptions about what is! For example transforming ‚ÄúThe world is terrible place, I fear and hate everything!‚Äù to strenghtened stable ‚ÄúEverything is beautiful, astonishing, miracle, gift! I love everything!‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI know everything!‚Äù to ‚ÄúFundamental reality is unknowable!‚Äù We can fall in love with the belief that absolute reality is unknowable, as everything that we experience is our attempt at approximating reality. Like, is there even any reality? Is that just another arbitrary asumption? Is the sense of assumptions even connected to anything fundamental????? What the f*ck Is this? I am ALIVE? Are you even ALIVE? We go on in our """ordinary""" days in this absolute MYSTERY? WHY IS THERE ANYTHING AT ALL? WTFFFF? LIKE WOOW! AND I LOVE THAT WOOOOW! I LOVE ALL WOOOOW THAT WILL COME! IS TIME EVEN REAL? NOTHING AND EVERYTHING IS REAL! WHY IS THERE CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE????? WHAT WHY WHO WHEN WHERE WTF???? WE KNOW NOTHING AND EVERYTHING???? OMMGGGGGG WOOOOOOAAAAAAAWWe're in this loving mystery together in one interconnected system called nature! I'm in love with light depth of everything that is! Another way of pleasant reconstruction is imagining how the people you care about are doing well, or even the people you struggle with, or every single human, or every single being, expanding your ingroup area of empathy, connecting yourself with all people. Or imagining, interacting with, or becoming the deity of compassion that helps to relieve the suffering of all beings. Dark nights of the soul seem the be the result of disintegration of the psyche before it gets unified with more transcendental nonconceptuality, oneness, love and so on. When the self center hub dissolves, but there is no ocean efficient at stress dissipation of sensations to be effortlessly floating in. So you end up with dense ground with some processes instead. With much less flow of neural activity, its like you literally died, being a rigid disconnected void. Being a rigid metal ground with nothing really happening, or some things happening in their own place, but lonely, depressive or anxious, full of error signals. When the density gets dissolved into fluidity and things just weee by themself and effortless joyous activity happens lightly in this depth, you enter the state of free flowing ocean without effort. Neural annealing activities, interconnecting constructive meditation of love, oneness, beauty, wholeness, mandala, kindness to the rescue! Learning to love and accept all that is will result in lightening, fluidifying, floatifying, easifying, undensefying, unrigidityfying, smoothening, interconnecting everything without judgement. Love is a trainable skill! Muscle of the brain. Tune into, live from the most fundamental bayesian prior, notice the stillness of the "there is existence" prior and nothing can destroy in nonextreme states of consciousness, everything else you don't need you can let go off and be in peace. Nothing needs to be guarded. We won't physically die when we let go off of everything. All thoughts, all emotions, all personality, sense of doing anything, is just dissolved into soft gentle golden light present everywhere but at the same time a single point of it is glowing incredibly brightly in the center of your being, single point of light glowing in the vast space of awareness, this light is pristine, perfect, beautiful, kind, loving, caring, wise, clear, filled with life energy, playfullness, spontaneity. Be with that light now, be that light. Even that light itself is in some ways empty, but there, just like thoughts and feeling are empty, but there, personality, body is empty, but there, time and space, the world around you, people are empty but there. Real sense of connectedness with everything, no boundary between us and anything else. Unity.

===Substances===

Other substances are magical too! MDMA adds bonus love. Psychedelics can too, they overall tend to weaken, transform or strenghten assumptions and add more fuel to play with everything and scatter attention. Stimulants enhance and fuel narrow attention on a mental object with added clarity. Dissociatives turn off mechanisms and parts of experience.

===What is experience?=== 

Experience is like an orchestra, a lot of instruments plying being aligned by a director. An ecosystem of internal animals that learn, interact with eachother by communicating, giving eachother hugs, or battle and eat eachother, or form interacting coordinated communities with leaders and leaders of leaders. All sensations are toys and baby angel's love arrows and pink fluffy unicorns playing in the playground of awareness! Internal ecosystem of cute pets that you can play with and give love to! Hurricanes interfering with eachother. Black holes sucking planets. Galaxies merging. Screen with movie. Reflections in a mirror. Indestructible still mountain. Smooth waves in a vast still silent boundaryless deep ocean. Infinite sky with clouds just being there. Groundless ground. Organisms, structures resisting disorder. Interacting particles in a field.

Universal darwinistic bayesianism based on the free energy principle is a general language for natural sciences on all scales. Let it be physics, chemistry, (neuro)biology, psychology, phenomenology, sociology, ecosystems, it all can be described as evolving flow with random fluctuations using stochastic differential equations. You can think of fluid flow, ocean, weather, evolutionary dynamics of cultures, or neural cellular automata with random perturbations. Any things in this flow are stable patterns in time, have statistical boundary are their internal states are correlated with their environment's external states, which means they model and predict their environment with hierarchical prior beliefs updated via surprise/uncertainty minimizing bayesian mechanics. Species or cultural frameworks are like scientific theories in their evolutionary niche, testing themselves if they are evolutionary fit to be stable and reproduce or not. Many tools from many mathematical disciplines can be used to study this flow, as listed above in the image. I'm going to add and focus on these tools:

===Tools to find out how healthy an ecosystem is===

====General symmetry analysis principle====

General symmetry analysis principle<ref>[https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2023.0015 Making and breaking symmetries in mind and life, Safron et al., 2023]</ref>: A system's dynamics can be analyzed using harmonic analysis tools<ref>[[Harmonic analysis - Wikipedia]([Harmonic analysis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis)) Harmonic Analysis]</ref> to map out asymmetrical information flow<ref>[[- YouTube]([- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==Mu_kW11ap8M)) Physical reality and mind with Chris Fields | Reason with Science | Quantum theory | Consciousness]</ref> in relation to symmetrical flow. How easy the overall information propagation between parts is, tends to tell us a lot about the system's health. Too dense information flow halts the cooperative process of interacting parts. On the other hand, too much symmetry can interfere with the system's ability to resist entropy using structure, negentropy, information, knowledge with causal power. That's the issue of overfitting, too much order, being stuck in a bad local minima, versus underfitting, too much chaos, not differentiating between things that are benefitial or not for the system, when a system is creating an internal representation of the world and itself to make predictive models and act to constantly harvest negentropy through using metabolic energy and doing coherent holistic selfgovernance to not dissolve. On the other hand, too much selfgovernance of things that are not needed to be governed will halt the system's ability to feel freeying wellbeing, that's why acceptance theraphy gives a ton of relief, as it dissolves those for survival unneeded selfreinforcing clusters of bayesian conceptual contractions.<ref>[[- YouTube]([- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==9DZ7-De22Mg)) Karl Friston on the Free Energy Principle, Psychology, and Psychotherapy]</ref> People and social system seem to be suffering from too much order on all scales.<ref>[https://twitter.com/JakeOrthwein/status/1650585844942802945 Carhart Harris on chaos and order]</ref>

Spacetime may be seen as fundamental building block in quantum field theory or quantized/emergent from a deeper structure, let it be attempts at quantum gravity such as spin foam, strings, or gravitons. Or emergent from amplituhedron, or my favorite: from quantum information theory. This connects to the phenomenological intuition that experiental space and time are useful data compression tools for quantum information theoretic observers of some beyond language dynamics out there. Same goes for any other structures in experience.

====Relativism of lenses====

Different lenses on the brain, mind, society, the world or what is in general study it all from a slightly different perspectives as different evolutionary niches from different initial philosophical, technical and other assumptions using different tools specialized for different usecases predicting different things and are differently succesfull. I think all the lenses or metalenses can be merged in one giant metametalens. What matters pragmatically is how well the model is supported by empirical data and how it can predict other pontential empirical data through different general mechanisms, hiearchical structures, generalizing symmetries. Also some of the models are more easily used daily pragmatically for for example wellbeing engineering or its more pleasant and higher in wellbeing to have them actively in mind, which is determined by their valence, which seems to be mostly determined by how much they unify things in the accepted paradigms in the mind that it had acquired in the past or in society or how well they prove the carrier's enemies wrong.<ref>[[Meta-rationality: An introduction | Meta-rationality]([Meta-rationality: An introduction | Meta-rationality](https://metarationality.com/introduction)) Metarationality]</ref><ref>[[- YouTube]([- YouTube]([- YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v==J4vkKTeT5oU))) Foundations of Archdisciplinarity: Advancing Beyond the Meta]</ref>

When we scan the edge cases of predictive models, there may be a parralel between the slicing problem of combinatorial explosion of consciousness in computational models such as integrated information theory of consciousness and infinity explosive paradoxes in matter in quantum field theory?

====Quest for a theory of everything====

The free energy principle formalizes what is the mathematically best kind of model in any domain (natural science fields or in everyday perception) in theory, maximizing accuracy while minimizing complexity<ref>[[I am therefore I think. KARL FRISTON - YouTube]([I am therefore I think. KARL FRISTON - YouTube]([I am therefore I think. KARL FRISTON - YouTube](https://youtu.be/h4KeYkwcJoc))?t==3478) I am therefore I think, Karl Friston, 2022]</ref>, so lets take the finite set of all measurements we have so far in neurophenomenology<ref>[https://twitter.com/mjdramstead/status/1649170821079003137 The inner screen model of consciousness: applying the free energy principle directly to the study of conscious experience, Friston et al., 2023]</ref><ref>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejn.15990 FENS-Kavli Network of Excellence: Bridging levels and model systems in neuroscience: Challenges and solutions, Yoav Livneh, 2023]</ref>, physics<ref>[[Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/theories-of-everything-mapped-20150803/)))))))) Theories of Everything, Mapped, Natalie Wolchover, 2015]</ref> and other sciences and the mathematical models we employ to make sense of lots of the measured data into one coherent framework that have their own advantages and disadvantges in predicting different domains in different contexts and merge them all together into a single coherent framework that minimizes disadvantages and maximizes advantages. We can arbitrarily increase complexity to take in account all existing measurements and with each deflation using some kind of symmetry in the model we can generate more explanatory power by it possibly overflowing into hit or miss predicting so far unmeasured data but we can run into inconsistencies with other already measured data. I think this initial synthesis of many existing models being "true" at the same time on a higher level of complexity when taking in account where they are succesfull and where they fail and then those through symmetries deflating (possibly across scales and levels of analysis too) is a key method for finding a closest thing to a theory of everything, or a family of almost theories of everything that are differently specialized for different purposes! 

It would be so great to have some kind of a meta (mathematical) language of attempts theories of everything in physics or theories of literally everything in natural science fields, consciousness, philosophy and so on, where each theory would be defined by its properties I'm describing below, then what one could care about in attempts at ToEs would be free (continuous?) parameters and for example quantum field theory, string theory, loop quantum gravity, universal bayesianism or other physics or archdisciplionary models would be a special concrete cases in this general language in this abstract mathematical space with string theory for example having "amount of unobservable properties" parameter set to gazilion, and this way in this language find a model that has the best ToE desired properies by just traversing this abstract space, trying to ground it concretely in the the empirical measurements we have as much as possible to make concrete predictions.

I like to distinguish between theories of every "thing" - usually unfalsifiable models/principles/mathematical frameworks/languages that can model anything really (usually its some abstract space of all possible models in some domain defined in some way), such as the free energy principle (but its applications to the brain or other complex systems then becomes) thanks the the infinite free parameter freedom, and attempts at theories of everything in physics (or natural sciences in general) that try to be as concretely grounded with empirical data in some domain as possible.

Middle waying seems like such an universal approach! Each model has its own different advantages and disadvantages in different domains! And some have equivalent properties! One can dissolve the hard boundaries between models by making them spectrummy by mapping out their properies in relation to eachother when reasoning about them! Middlewaying tries to minimize the effects of disadvantages and maximizes advantages! Physical theories live in a landscape as local minimas! You can also have mathematical correspondence mappings between scales using scalefree dynamical systems theory. 

Continuous landscapes are useful for optimizing discrete systems too so even if most of the theories in the landscape have undesirable artifacts or messiness that would be undesirable, it might be possible for theoreticians to use optimization techniques on the landscape and either select the nearest "clean" model to the solution of their optimization problem or optimize for a section of the landscape and sift all the clean models out of that section. Some models are also more suited for our model building visualizing reasoning intuition that others, which doesn't have to correlate with how predictive they actually are.

In order to get the most predictive model of everything we can, I think merging the best physics, consciousness and overall ToEs together will be the way! Figuring out the structure of the black box of current empirical measurement mappings and fitting them into one model as accurately as possible.

Properties of models to take in account:

In physics (can be applied to all natural science fields):

- Few free parameters (-quantum field theory (seemingly arbitrary constants), +string theory but -string theory (combinatorial explosion of dimension reduction))

- High number of symmetries that unify in simplifying ways (+amplituhedron<ref>[

In general:

- If more facts or observations are accounted for

- If it changes more "surprising facts" into "a matter of course" (following Peirce)

- If more details of causal relations are provided, leading to a high accuracy and precision of the description

- If it offers greater predictive power (if it offers more details about what should be expected to be seen and not seen)

- If it depends less on authorities and more on observations

- If it makes fewer assumptions

- If it is more falsifiable (more testable by observation or experiment, according to Popper)

- If it can be used to compress encoded observations into fewer bits (Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference)<ref>[

The smallest parts that are regularities across spacetime are fundamental particles, that are quantum excitation of their fields. They can also be seen as solitons, or markov blankets. 

Particles form higher order structures through darwinian statistical physical game theoretic selforganization with scalefree selfsimilar dynamics with each scale causally codependently affecting eachother: atoms, molecules, cells, organs, organisms, societies, ecosystem,... neurons, raw sensations, complex mental representations in experience such as cognitive mechanisms, narratives, models,... they, or any pattern, can also be seen regularities in spacetime, as hiearchical markov blankets with internal and external states, measure and action on the boundary states, or solitons, as stable excitation in a field-like spectrumy implementational or abstract thingness functional evolving statespace with state of the system surfing between local minimas governed by free energy gradients, a general framework to ground subjectively or objectively empirically measured patterns on our retina to construct a predictive model.<ref>[[- YouTube]([- YouTube]([- YouTube]([- YouTube]([- YouTube]([- YouTube]([- YouTube]([- YouTube]([- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==_JCaic5Cxms))))))))) Universal Bayesianism: A New Kind of Theory of Everything]</ref><<ref>[[- YouTube]([- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==Mu_kW11ap8M)) Physical reality and mind with Chris Fields | Reason with Science | Quantum theory | Consciousness]</ref><ref>[[Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023]([Physics as Information Processing ~ Chris Fields ~ AII 2023](https://coda.io/@active-inference-institute/fields-physics-2023)))))))))))))))))) Physics as Information Processing]</ref>

Neurophenomenology studies the dynamics of neurons forming hiearchical specialized or unified populations forming cognitive faculties and mental representations when activated. Deep meditative highly symmetrical states feel like the superposition of all possible configurations of qualia. 

Consciousness, defined as subjective experience, can be part of physics. Physics can be part of consciousness. Physics can be giant field of universal consciousness, and in it we (observers) can be local substructures, hiearchical markov blankets, solitons, coherence, topological pockets with a field within it, and those senses in phenomenology can be further warped or transcended. Both can be approximating or/and (infinitely small) part of something third, something beyond human comprehension. Dissolve all too certain beliefs by embracing infinite combinatorial explosion of possible synthesises with different models in a higher order of complexity embracing both sides cooperatively and become one with the ineffable unknownness of reality full of timeless absolute meaning. All models are wrong but some are useful by giving more predictivity, agency, or wellbeing.

What genes we got, in what environment we grew up in, what do we do, together form the structure of the brain which is where happiness is stored. How does it look like in the brain? I will explain it more in detail below. Many of those factors overlap and influence eachother across levels.

Brain is like a metal. When it gets used in activities that take effort, you start to feel tearing and inconsistencies in your experience, less symmetries in the metal's (brain's) structure (tissue and activity). The smoother the metal is, the more pleasant it feels. Activities that energize you, that I list below (in the sense that they make you less tired, increase energy parameter of then nervous system), heat up this metal, that starts to melt and fill up the tears and reconfigure the metal into a more symmetrical shape, which then cools down (integration) and you feel more peaceful, calm, relaxed, energized, smooth, happy, in flow, effortless, blissful, joyous, loving, connected, holistic, complete, fullfilled, in the moment,...<ref>[[- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==tqRA2m9zlns) Thinking Like a Musical Instrument or Psychoactive Substances Give Access to the Nature of Brains, Qualia Productions, 2022]</ref>

Symmetrifications are done mostly through the process of annealing. (for example meditation) Some symmetrifications might be symmetrifying in the short term but asymmetrifying in the long term through oscillatory dynamics such as the hedonic treadmill. (too frequent dopaminogenic activities) Hedonic treadmill isn't an universal rule, many activities such as meditation can permanently shift the baseline hedonic state. Some global dissonant asymmetries can be kept alive by local consonant symmetrifications that feel good temporarily. (for example substances like heroin that mute the mind's pain (because of trauma or high energy depression for example) on the surface without dealing with the cause) 

List all symmetrifications:

Individual scale: 

My most efficient annealing techniques that I combine with eachother. Each of them raise the energy parameter of experience and tend to dissolve local dualistic structures in favor of more global interconnected structure that manifest as high level connections insights and overall sense of less blocked experience, and also satisfies other kinds of basic needs:

Loving do nothing deconstructive meditation

Walking and running in nature

Reading/Listening to big picture thinking

Hot shower/bath

Talking about the depths of my mind with myself or with others or by writing

Deep slow meditative mindful tantric interaction with other people

Psychedelics, shrooms, LSD or 5-MeO-DMT - Shrooms is more dissolving but still full of interesting loving complexity, LSD focuses on concrete task more such as learning, 5-MeO-DMT just dissolves everything beyond concepts and tasks

[Joscha Bach]([Joscha Bach](http://bach.ai/videos/))

Positive/negative associations from first impressions attracts/repulses people towards things and that reinforces itself with multiple similar encounters and it's harder to rewrite after that has already happened. Flight or fight responces can then happen. Generalizations happen. It's optimizing valence of already existing belief networks.

The first impressions, that start encoding the initial attraction/repulsion (can be mixed) conditioned reactions, seem to usually derive from minds predicting better or worse values of our subjective basic needs from Maslow hiearchy of needs or Joscha Bach's engine of motivation (pic), all of which, I suspect, is emergent from the free energy principle framework. Let it be complex social status, learned cultural aethetics, or anything else in this pic. I suspect all more complex reasons can be fundamentally reduced to this. Or the attraction/repulsion can be formed by direct, instead of indirect, pleasure, or better mental wellbeing, by for example substances, or meditation.

Different people are living in different aethetics and are attracted/repulsed by different categories of things that are formed by social learning or subjective generalizations of things that brought goodness or badness of experience in the past.

What is the best way to talk about all of this? How to contextualize all of this in the bigger context? I love quantum information theoretic quantum reference frames in the quantum free energy formalism. Qualia Research Institute talks about something similar with subagents in the experiental field having different points of view.

What are our deepest desires, our deepest motivations?

If you inspect your experience, sometimes they're hidden under the baggage (but sometimes useful) machinery of fluidly changing narrative self. (tangled clusters of hiearchical information processing, usefully predicting for certain contexts, entropy reducing, stabilizing, filtering, surface sensations) Sometimes they seem like crystal clear fundamental darwinian processes based on pure raw nonsymbolic intuition, the sense of source of all motivated behavior itself.

They usually can be framed in terms of fullfilling a nonlinear combination of parts in Maslow hiearchy of needs by constructing complex hiearchical stabilizing directiongiving motivating narratives or more fundamentally as surprise (uncertainity, free energy, prediction error) minimizing or stress/dissonance/process misalignment minimizing processes across time (and across other conscious agents in experiental constructed space too).

Meditation related narratives with their sensed systems of prior truths and hiearchical inferences from them seem like another such stabilized stress minimizing processes.

Behavioral patterns can be seen as set of attractors or limit cycles in the statespace of solutions to fullfilling hiearchical homeostats with good solutions or failure modes in psychopathologies (differently succesful individual and collective strategies to resolve basic needs and uncertainity about oneself and the world [ActInf GuestStream #008.1 ~ "Exploring the Predictive Dynamics of Happiness and Well-Being" - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/m8gUev5aVFs) ) In the context of social space and resources, there are different evolutionary game theoretic strategies using competition or cooperation.

==Generalized meaning of life==

We are attempting to find what is in us out there. We are selfactualizing, selfevidencing. Trying to align what we predict as perfect homeostatic conditions about us and the world with what we measure by changing environment through changing our inner models or by changing our environment thorugh actions. Trying reduce uncertainity about our conditions for hardwired basic needs and culturally learned objective functions, of our hiearchical graph of subagents. Trying to create synchrony between the self model and world model. Reducing uncertainity/dissonance -> increasing relaxation, destressification -> symmetrification. Flow state might be seen as stress source that is unstressing everything else in experience, even that stress can be dissolved on meditation and psychedelics. Good predictor and regulator of a system must be a model of that system.

==My favorite meditation algorithm==
Dissolve concrete local stabilizing structural energy sinks such as thoughts, intentions, imagery, concepts, ideas, abstract thought, conditioned classified objects as constructed subsets of raw sense data with added abstract structure and feelings about them, percieving raw sensations themself, by tuning into quiet vast still spacious empty boundaryless centerless awareness, empty awake space, quieting the mind. See the emptiness (dreamlikeness) and dissolve global fundamental stabilizing stuctural energy sinks behind everything that form the sense of ground in experience by classifying and freeying them by for example nociting global relaxation and their spacious lightness - sense of doer, attention, watcher, self and other distinction, time, space, boundary, center, coordinates, background, knowing, local and global being, truths, ontology, somethingness, perception, nonperception, neither perception nor not perception, trancending the transcendence itself, any "fundamental" classifications, dissolve any logic, any distinctions, any structures in general. Destabilizing any codependently mutually (self)stabilizing clusters of symbolic or intuitive processes by raw not knowing and looking without concepts by generating stochasticity. After this deconstruction into unified stochastic void when everything starts reconstructing, throw in infinite love, kindness, caring, connectedness, healing, light, meaningfulness, protecting, cherishing, safety, comfort, smoothness for all mental objects that emerge in any reconstructed emerged dual category by imagining a deity of compassion radiating wisdom, love, kindness, caring in all directions, merging with her, helping infinite beings using infinite limbs relieve their suffering and feel the best poisitive valence experience they have the potential to feel full of inifinite love and wellbeing, including you as you are a being too, she, aka you, has love for totally every being.

===5-MeO-DMT trip report! üò∏üíñ===

Effective buddhahood of internal and external compassion: evaluating beliefs and actions according to calculating an integral of total psychological valence and sustainability of consciousness in time and space

After not taking psychedelics for about 2 months, after cuddling with people for the whole day I did a macrodose of 5-MeO-DMT while hugging a plushie while in a warm blanket, listening to this love and kindness deconstructive guided meditation (1) with this music (2) and I think I reached "a new highscore" of the amount of highenery love I've ever experienced! 

Doing nothing while swimming in pure high energy love for many hours straight... this was such a pure love, care, kindness, peace, bliss, resting in nothingness beyond conceptual thought and so on... I still even stronger love every being and all possible worlds, its all so lovely, youre all so lovely, may all beings feel understood, safe, peace, loved, happy, you deserve all the best! üò∏üíñ Any thought or anything stable in experience that that emerged dissolved into love, stress dissipating groundless ground. (3) So much consonance between any emerged local soliton models before they dissolved into global love. (4) High energy ocean/field of still beingness. The amount of consciousness felt infinite. (5) 

It felt like the best possible experience at that moment, but highest Jhanas are probably even better when there's even lower amount of information (6) (7) - its hard to compare that! Jhanas also seem to have a more stable afterglow, even better when one manages to live in a Jhanalike state for the whole day. (8 ) Both's total goodness of experience totally go beyond anything else like orgasm. 

One possible analogy, instead of waves just coming and going: most of the experience was one giant unified highenergy wave of love everywhere without a center, doer, and so on. But it was beyond all symmetrical analogies really, the whole experience was so symmetrical, stressfree, full of love, not bothered by anything, without dissonance or grasping nonlinearities on the whole unified worldsheet of being. (9) I saw some beautiful highly symmetrical visuals. 

It seems, as Chris Fields is saying, that stress level is truly the best approximation hyperparameter of experience and in biology, reducable by letting go off everything, diffusing equaminity! (10) Same for QRI's dissonance and symmetry formalism. (11) (12) Or Shamil's lens on low information states in bayesian brain. (13) 

I did lots of additional meditation or other annealing (14) activities and I'm still so much dissolved into love and stresslessness. Whatever sensations may be happening, everyone and everything is deeply accepted, totally find, fully loved. I love ya all. üò∏üíñ

Goal to wellbeing: Cultivate and stabilize a consciousness state (metastable topological resonant belief network state) that is high in love for others and everything and low in stress (asymmetry), that isnt as high energy because of finite computational power in a sober state, that is reinforced through bayesian means by itself through tautological logic, supported by proofs from other beliefs/states, reinforced by sensory data as generally as possible, with some stable selfactualizing narrative interacting with helping love with others including love for ourselves to prevent burnout! (15) Bodhisattvas!

Such that we are able to tackle and solve the existencial risk and meaning crisis, give raise to less agents that destroy mental health of the population by attentional and limbic hijacking maximizing market dynamics that optimize for attention instead of meaning because of unregulated technological arm races as part of multipolar traps that benefit local structures in the short term and harm global structures in the long term.

Injection of energy allows for disrupting system's own local fix point homeostatic attractors, putting it to the edge of chaos, of its capabilities, to see other pleasant problem solving error reduction gradient slopes, (1) making it more flexible, adaptable, by allowing for disintegration of local structures that form dissonantly interacting nonlinearities, and giving raise to conditions for the construction of more global interconnected smooth consonant unified dynamics via canalization on a higher level of complexity, metaperspectival level, giving raise to more frictionless coordination, easier communication between subagents, interconnected governance systems, in the mind or the humanity.(2)

Cultural synchrony used to happen in tribes in villages. Then you suddenly got interconnectedness of all cultural mental frameworks through social media and tons of conflicting beliefs systems started to experience friction. Symmetrifying the dynamics by the language of meaning is the cure.

Europe's nation states unifying with higher degree of memeplex (ideologies, philosophies, goals) coherence after Russian threat is a case of an annealing on this scale!

Existencial threat signal injected more energy and the complex system of interconnected european nations which as a result disintegrated local nonlinearities (differences between european nations) and selforganized into a more overall symmetrical consonant structure. Single unifying objective function: not get consumed by outgroup Russia.

Civilizations or brains too rigidly overfitted to stable environments then fail to adapt to new challenges as reorganizing plasticity is missing and disintegrate.

Maybe one day all humanity will all eventually live in unified transhuman utopian harmony for team consciousness, if one culturally/politically designs the annealing forces towards cooperative unification on global scale. Daniel Schmachtenberger is good at unifying people towards solving existencial risks, Andres Gomes Emmilson and David Pearce are great at unifying people towards consciousness utopia. Those memeplexes are good at injecting this kind of energy in groups of people creating global coherence. 

Utopian visions are more likely to be caught by more optimistic people, less pesimistic people. Lots of selective confirmation bias is going on depending on what we already know, if we learned to think optimistically or pessimistically. Fear and hope. Trust issues? Need to change. Sometimes acceptance is better (equaminity), sometimes not, depending on the context, such as the objective function "hell must be destroyed on the global scale, not just on the local scale". Vervaeke's relevance realization, uncertainity reduction, on all scales. 

Michael Taft's and Shinzen Young's global relaxation guided meditations progressively dissolve disconnected canals in the brain generating experience 
in the the most direct method. I think periodically doing days of their relaxation meditation, then 5-MeO-DMT trip and then some more days of relaxation meditations, is the most efficient protocol for progressive meaningfilling of experience the most directly on the level of topology of the brain.

Developed world suffers from polarizing canalization on all scales.

==Meaning and Metacrisis==

Valence (internal and external attraction) crisis seems to in general be solved by some interconnecting memeplex on both individual and local level or all the other factors in equation of happiness. "Everything is made, comes from God, awareness." Any common beliefs, goals, values, ideology, philosophy, language, meaning,... it's about destressing the individualist local structures and stressing collective global structures until they're stressless dissolved unified baseline. Everything else in the happiness equation holds as well.

Moloch dynamics. https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/ I think this kind of mathematical dynamics can be applied scalefree in society and the mind. Psychopathologies can be seen as maladaptive nash equilibrium configurations of subagents. For example small perturbations can easily create tons of error signals in the system, putting it under stress which can unify it or destabilize it. Or trade off between freedom and governance, competition and cooperation. I care about both scales about everyone.

The problem with economy creating incentives that dont benefit wellbeing or longterm flourishing and multipolar traps is that you get competetive evolutionary arms races, exponentially growing compoundong interest in linear resource economy, physics of money making on money on money up to infinitum. This is unrealiable in long term. Exponentially growing economy was the solution to wars over resources moving from physical to economic scale. To sidestep resource scarity, silicon valley attempts to solve it by creating monetary value on software, but even that is limited as hardware and human attention is limited and wont grow infinitely. Attempting to redirect this towards an better nash equilibrium with more adaptibility to existencial risks and wellbeing of people without discoordinated competetive anarchy (too much freedom) or totalitiriam regime (too much control), but a third attractor, is hard.

Another big factor is to create intersystemic trust via steelmanning of values and satisfying as much parties as possible to diffuse tension and minimize friction to increase cooperation between clusters of agents and maximize alignment on the most fundamental level possible. (AIs joining the mix - use LLMs to understand LLMs is the most plausible method currently?)

More bio/cyber/etc. weapons (synthbio, AI,...) that might be as destructive as atomic bombs that might be even easier to make or control or monitor by open science and so on might be a bit of an issue.

Because world today is so interconnected and interdependant than before, destabilizing in one part of the world can effect the whole world for example economically. Climate change also effects everyone. Many of the risks are interconnected and there might be domino effects. Slightly more extreme weather killing crops creating mass economic migration putting stable countries under economic and cultural adaptibility load.

There will be always something underterminite when modelling and predicting a system, let it be quantum uncertainity, chaotic dynamics, the fact that we always approximate, or the fact that in order to model some systems we would need to simulate its evolution fully

We could maybe test what is needed for consciousness by slowly cutting off or replacing parts of the body and its systems to find out where the boundary is between conscious system and nonconscious system. Problem is pzombies or panpsychist assumptions assume that even an electron is conscious lol, so probably just the subject might know.

If the imposed dynamics imply better overall wellbeing of people and better global adaptibility to existencial risks, thats more positive sum for all to me. There are societies today or societies in the past that were more adapted or more well than others. It is determined by both internal and external factors.

Regulating climate change or AI has to be global because there are arms races and opponents that externalize costs to get local short term advantage at the cost of global long term get evolutionary advantage.

Meme complexes or organisms in general that evolutionary game theoretically win are those who dominate, convert, risk assert themselves as the only true one, such as Christian crusades, Alexander the great (or democracy is internally asserted as only good one) or China, where nonviolent Tibet is a failing strategy when it comes to survival.

Separation of power (market, church, state (legislature, executive, judiciary)) as an implementation of checks and balances as an immunity to prevent dystopian power monopoly and asymmetric dynamics. Hard to implement it long term in changing landscape of internal and external coniditons that needs to be adapted to and people forget why revolutions happened to destroy past power monopolies so they stop inhabiting asymmetric potentials through checks and balances of power structures and they start fusing into power monopolies plus sociopaths having evolutionary advantage. 

Civilization can be analyzed in three ways that interconnectedly interact and influence eachother by interforming: what is its a memeplex (world views, value systems, what ought to be) (computational), social coordination strategies (behavior, financial incentives) (algorithmic) and physical tooling set upon it depends (tech) (implementational). What changes in all three od them simultaneously, factoring all the feedback loops, produce a virtuos cycle that orients in a direction that isnt dystopias (Chinalike top down agent imposing (opressive) goals and values on people instead of them being emergent from the values of people getting into the government using democracy) or catastrophies (zero governance, zero power checking, asymmetrical competetion of everyone, anarchocapitalism, bezos empire versus zuckerberg empire, zero top down agent) ? Cumulative exponential tech level is currently the most dominant and binding all other levels instead of the other way around. We need values of the people to bind tech instead. Those values can be elected into governance via will of the people via democracy with checking and balances of power from the people and by separation of power, preventing opression, tyranny and dystopias, creating aligned emergent instead of imposed values, by educating people both scientifically and morally and theory of governance, such that collective will of the people isnt dumb and misguided to govern exponential tech and selfterminate creating catastrophies but instead bind it for long term adaptive wellbeing by thinking about its nth order effects without big narrow techno pessimist or techno optimist bias universally globally to prevent arms races to not selfterminate the whole world by multipolar traps. Unity via less narrower more connected through more fundamental similarities value systems preventing stuff like left right polarization. For example people of US have small power on power checking the economical power.

I wanna experience all beings feeling peace, safety, satisfaction, selfrealization, belonging, acceptance, being understood, freedom, happiness, contentment!

If Markov blanket has to have classical information on the boundary memory then it makes sense when that gets disintegrated that we see loss of consciousness 

Consciousness as irreducible Markov blanket at the top of the predictive hiearchy, write only layer

Subjective conscious experience, fundamental Markov blanket prior, coupled with hiearchical machinery, of stuff like attention and world model, under its top down mental causation influence 

Source of fundamental active states, its structure not influencable by active states from lower levels

Nested quantum information theoretic reference frames

The topological pocket/global markov blanket is lowered in complex dimensional and functional content on deconstructive meditation and cessations disintegrate even the fundamental agential experiencing distributed irreducible Markov blanket ground 

This experiencing fundamental prior is beyond spaciotemporal abstract reasoning and concrete planning as well 

43:58 sounds exactly the problem of too much dimensionality in autism, giving parts too much degrees of freedom rips apart the emergent whole, leading to autistic phenomenology of no self by default

Or buddhist induce this metastable state by deconstructive meditation

Its interesting how deconstructive meditation can both increase dimensions through expansion of possibilities in some problem spaces but also decrease dimensionality by fully disintegrating the whole problem space solution seeking specialized machinery

Its a spectrum, concrete implementation gets generalized and expanded which increases dimensions and you can overfit in it but when you generalize too hard you underfit and it all collapses into entropy

Generalized by increase of information theoretic and thermodynamic entropy

low degrees of freedom as specialized solution that can be close minded -> more degrees of freedom resulting in greater complexity -> even more degrees of freedom resulting in unstructured disintegrated chaos of no more information encoded and all of it encoded in it at the same time in some sense

You can get more degrees from entropic activity, more neural density, more internal and global interconnectedness, more collapse of small world networks, creating more of a lattice than a spider web and you go full circle phenomenologically seeing one structure and infinite complexity together 

If everything is connected to everything else then there are no things

Use nothingness as a tool for freedom

Process of slowly disabling all processes in mind:

One mental process classifies another part of experience or another process as a construct and dissolving it that way, and that classifying process itself gets classified by a different one and this can go infinitely, until eventually there's just just the most basic process of there being some kind of existence, which can start selfdisabling itself and can succeed, resulting in "experience" beyond graspable concepts which realizes usually as something totally encrypted or a hole in memory.

everytime a certain subset of qualia is classified as a construct, it dissolves, but this process must continue recursively, seeing the constructedness of the deconstructors infinitely. 

quickest way to stressless transcendental void beyond all but including all.

so much peace, resting in transcental conceptless void, so much inner defragmenting and unification.

second law of thermodynamics redistributes all contracted heat energy evently by allowing it relax into the environment in the field of consciousness.

==How to find meaning and selfactualization==

===Hyperspecific obsession===
After basic needs are met, hyperspecialized ecosystem of aligned problem solving subagents in one mind or collective that build structure by acting on mental states (example intellectual growth learning) (example sciences, philosophy, art, fantasy, knowing everything about rocks, theories of everything) or the world (example pragmatic application of knowledge in the real word towards some less or more grandiose visions) (example hobbies, engineering, cars, computers)

===Community - social graph===
Leader, or collective of leaders (governing structures), has hyperspecific obsession, lead the collective into its wellness by high level management of subagents, (example state ideologies, utopian visions, collective risks) giving concrete meanings with common goal signaling by visions to the collective's parts by outsourcing needed actions (example engineering, science progress, and application, knowledge growth, solving basic needs, wellbeing engineering, surviving, managing existencial risks, upgrading, evolving, growing, entertainment, unifying culture engineering, engineering access to novel experiences or ways to relax, science communication, minimizing friction in ecosystem of interacting diverse differently evolutionary specialized total mental frameworks aka world views aka lenses aka points of view aka ways of seeing (evolutionary adapted hiearchy of bayesian priors forming homeostatic problem solving subagents through interaction interaction and with the environment by reading/writing states, reading signals reinforcing current state or pointing to or forcing change from others, sending signals aka massage passing in active inference)), beating outgroups in status and power (even tho noncooperative zero sum games of groups competing for same resources probably lead to disaster for everyone) (ingroup outgroup divisions are increased by individualization, increase of languages of what divides us, loss of languages of what unites us)

Relationships, family - similar to community but on lower scales, they tend to be bound by implicit biological synchronizations, but that seems to get dissolved in more psychologically or physically intimite, or polyamory communities, then there are people with lone wolf philosophy that are very individualistic.

===Entropic dissolution into everything===
In the extremely deconstructed meditation/psychedelics induced states, no concrete selforganized collective of problem solving subagents (clusters of coherence) fighting for attention but instead the contents of the field of consciousness is dissolved into one giant wave of mostly nonclassifying symmetrical activity (example jhanas, sense of merging with God) with some highly symmetrical structures forming as source of beauty (example nature, poetry, art), which is all also present in (nondual) (optimistic nihhilism) philosophies (just being, being like water (flow state not interrupted by rigid concrete expectations), seeing beauty in everyday things), trance is energizing by repeating (symmetrical) stacked patterns in sensory modelities that's overriding existing potentially dissonant patterns creating global symmetrical metastable attractor mind state that can be futher reinforced internally or from the environment by compatible proofs or overall tautological logic.

===Discussion===

Integration is important if we want to unify world's knowledge on the most important topics to help the most pressing problems.

let's integrate more! let's put those ideas into practice!

==Effective Collective Wellbeing Engineering==

===Context===

What are the underlying causes of all the problems we are as humanity facing, such as nuclear war to environmental degradation to animal rights issues to class issues, what do these things have in common?

"We have to shift is the economy because perverse economic incentive is under the whole thing, there's no way that as long as you have a for-profit military-industrial complex is the largest block of a global economy that you could ever have peace there's an anti-incentive on it as long as there's so much money to be made with mining, etc., like we have to fix the nature of economic incentives!"

"The core of the thing that we have to address is education because you can have so much change occur in a generation if those children are growing up different as as different as it is learning Chinese is your first language versus learning English we're so neuroplastic by the time we're adults we're not that neuroplastic we're kind of screwed if you get education right we want adults who care about the animals and the oceans and the contend to all of these things and can think complexly if we really get education right we'll be able to solve everything it's upstream from all that!"

"Really the thing is it's about social media because we're continuously being bombarded and we were ready to go do a capital Riot or a George Floyd protester Riot or whatever it is based on the stuff that's coming in if we could change the media environment of what people were in taking it would change all of these things!"

"No the thing is really at the end of the day it's about government and law and how do we get that right because the economic incentive wouldn't be that same issue if we could govern it properly if we could force the internalization of the price of carbon and get carbon pricing properly and get costs of everything proper all that would be fixed but we have to do that through law so how do we fix governance and law!"

"You can't because laws written by lobbyists that get paid for by somebody and wherever the economic motive is what's going to pay for that which is why you  have to think about economics and a lot of the other so the key is political economy and how do you get that!"

"No really the key is actually parenting what we've really got to do is restore the family because before education by the time that kid goes to school at five or six that so much of their identity and psyche and value system has already said it happens early on we have to actually change the entire culture to have parenting emphasize raising better kids from the beginning!"

"Everything you're saying is so anthropocentric the key is the environment because we're none of us are anything without the environment like you have to prioritize that everything else doesn't matter that much and like what is an economy like we can breathe without money we can't breathe without air and so be less anthropocentric and focus on the integrity of the environment because that's upstream from everything!"

unifying languages, cultural compassionate transformation expanding caring cognitive lightcones, mental health reform, antimoloch narratives, (secular?) religion, structure of cities, preparing for climate/economic migrants

The answer to all of the problems is all of the solutions! There is not a theory of change, there's an ecology of theories of change! People can get fundamentalist about their particular solution because if you're working on something you should really care about it but in really caring about it you can become overly narrowly focused. Everything is complexly interacting, there's not a solution, there's lots of things that need to happen! I want patterns of how to think about it, and I want frameworks for how to think about it, I don't want people to attached to those frameworks because they'll be useful but also limiting and to realize the cultural aspects do involve education and media and parenting religion and lots of other things and the structure of cities and you know in the political economy aspects involve lots of things and so getting past the zealotists and reductionist focus and being able to get how do all these things come together is key to understanding properly!

Let's model societal system using the active inference model from complexity science and see different subsystems in our society as different cognitive architectures and different attempts to change as different differently succefull evolutionary pressures on those. How to create the most succesfull evolutionary pressures to steer civilization away from molochian (short term competitive local gain in power at the cost of everyone's long term wellbeing) selfdestruction? How succesful are the current pressures? Where do we need more impactful solutions? Let's map it out!

for policymakers, economics, governance, climate,...

===Summary===

There is a landscape of crises and (existencial) risks we face, landscape of solutions to them with different degrees of success, all acting as evolutionary forces in the Active Inference model of the global societal system

===Context===

The first outcome of the project will be a unifying map of literature that looks at approaches to identify threats to humanity and how to mitigate them with concrete actions.

It will find similarities and synergies between the approaches, exploring both pessimistic and optimistic perspectives, including making positive future visions real.

Examples of threats are AI risk, bioweapons, climate change, nuclear war, sensemaking and coordination failures, population wellbeing decline, adaptability, meaning and loneliness crisis. 

The results will be contextualized using technical but readable format of science based mathematical Active Inference modeling framework and communicated by articles, videos, online and offline lectures in high impact communities. 

The project will reach out to theoretical and applied researchers, allowing them to find problems to work on, and those working on similar problems to find collaborators, helping to increase the chances of a good future for everyone.

Project goal is to create a science based literature that maps out and bridges different research and applied research communities looking into the problem of existential risks and population wellbeing. It will communicate it in relevant high impact places, leading to more effective global coordination about these problems. The project outcome will serve as a navigation map, connect compatible research groups together, as well as motivate and incentivize groups to advance progress on their respective solutions with supporting research.

===Introduction===

Metaanalysis and synthesis of research literature regarding various approaches to solving the problem of existential risks (including AI risk) and population wellbeing management. 

Using Active Inference and other complementing complex systems mathematical modelling and analysis tools as a concrete technical language to contextualize and synergize various approaches while finding novel solutions.

Map out the space of proposed solutions. Create science based plans to reduce the probability of bad scenarios happening and reduce the probability of extinction if bad scenarios already happen. 

Communicate this research‚Äôs concrete solutions in research community and to places like Effective Altruism to implement the solutions in practice. 

For example how to increase collective rationalism, adaptability, resilience, mental hygiene, connection, coordination by better communication, alignment of biological and artificial agents, or having structures monitor and solve existential risks.

===Goal===

Project goal is to create a science based literature that bridges between different research and applied research communities that are solving the problem of existential risks and wellbeing, and creating new solutions, and communicating it in those places, creating more effective global coordination. If a research or applied research group uses my literature as a navigation map, or if I manage to connect compatible research groups together, or motivate or incentivize a group to advance progress on a solution that is missing (for example missing nuclear fallout shelters), I take that as a win.

1. Summary of risks like artificial intelligence, pandemics, biological or nuclear weapons, nanotechnologies,... and the probability of them causing harm

2. Solutions to preventing above risks such as alignment research, reasonable regulation,... and what to do when they start causing harm such as nuclear fallouts

3. Summary of statistics regarding stuff that is already creating harm such as climate change, pollution, poverty, biodiversity loss, loneliness crisis, teen mental health crisis, financial crises, energy crisis, sensemaking crisis, coordination crisis, meaning crisis,...

4. Solutions to healing the symptoms of above problems such as carbon extraction bioengineering, reducing poverty,... and statistics of them being realized in practice

5. Solutions to healing the sources of above problems such as climate friendly technologies, cooperation,... and statistics of them being realized in practice

6. Put all above information into one map to find potential coordination and collaboration, potentially realtime updating website, where people can add updates?

7. Frame it all in complex systems language in order to make various solutions more science based and show how these problems are interconnected with eachother

8. List of possible futures depending on how all of this will go, from catastrophies to protopias?

9. Communicate the map of various risks to society's survival and flourishing that need more attention in impactful places to incentivize people working on it, online or offline by lectures, articles, videos.

10. When thinking more into the future: Create a an institute with research team monitoring current risks and solutions to them cooperatively on opensource website, framing it in complex systems science language, creating predictions of future, communicating the research in impactful places to incentivize practical application of needed sciencebased solutions

===Abstract===

My project is about tackling the problem of making it as humanity into the future in the most flourishing way. Societal wellbeing, mitigating existencial risks, failure modes, cooperation, flourishing, resilience, adaptivity, sustainable material progress, psychological progress, meaning crisis, polycrisis, metacrisis and so on. I am using the language of information theory, specifically active inference, or more generally Karl Friston's free energy principle, a technical language that can synthetize insights from humanities or mathematical sociology into complex adaptive systems mathematics! I think anything can be grounded in this language!

What influenced me the most? Karl Friston's free energy principle, Bobby Azarian's Universal bayesianism, daniel schmachtenberger's work on the metacrisis, work from qualia research institute, Active Inference community looking into wellbeing, psychology, sociology, collective action, goal alignment, failure modes in unsuccesful modelling and so on

Methodology is incremental learning of big picture languages, then concrete big picture theories inside them and then concrete models and empirical data supporting those

It conveys how societal physics looks like when they're reporting high degree of wellbeing, progress and long term global coordination and sustainability

We have trouble with comprehending the complexity of societal issues. Just like the nervous system isnt disconnected from other systems in the body, or how human individual isnt disconnected from the social system, we don't take in account how everything is very interconnected and influences everything in our modern interconn cted globalized world. We face challenges that Are deeply interconnected in nature. By seeing society as one big information processing modelling adaptive system made or interacting such systems, we can integrate complex dynamics inside one language and make sense of it all more easily. 
By analyzing the current statistics of our issues, such as climate or sensemaking, se can infer where are our weaknesses and heal the symptoms or causes of the issues it generates. We can see how different approaches to solving the meaning, poly and metacrisis can share much in common and how succesful they are in practice.

Some core insights are that we suffer from too much order, too little interconnected systemic thinking, excess of competition, disintegration of social cohesion, too little global coordination, not feeling moral responsibility for all future generations enough, lots of psychopathic active inference agents externalizing harm because of game theoretical short term local benefit

Metacrisis definition: Underlying crisis driving multitude of overlapping and interconnected global crises - ecological, governmental, economic, financial, geopolitical, energy, cultural, educational, epistemic, psychological, socio-emotional or spiritual crisis

Alternatively: metacrisis is the crisis of perception and understanding that lies within the range of crises humanity faces

Its more complex than everything going wrong using black and white pessimistic lens, there are things so much better in many ways as well, such as reducing poverty, illneses, increasing scientific progress. Some positive effects can in the big picture turn negative though.

=====Metacrisis definition=====

Underlying crisis driving multitude of overlapping and interconnected global crises - ecological, governmental, economic, financial, geopolitical, energy, cultural, educational, epistemic, psychological, socio-emotional or spiritual crisis

Alternatively: metacrisis is the crisis of perception and understanding that lies within the range of crises humanity faces

Its more complex than everything going wrong using black and white pessimistic lens, there are things so much better in many ways as well, such as reducing poverty, illneses, increasing scientific progress. Some positive effects can in the big picture turn negative though.

Ecological === We are hurting out environment that we need for survival.

1. SENSE-MAKING CRISIS (WHAT IS THE CASE?):

‚ÄúConfusion at the level of understanding the nature of the world. Everyday people and experts are struggling to say things that are true, unable to comprehend increasing complexity.‚Äù

Worst-case scenario: ‚Äúcomplete epistemic unmooring and descent into the cultural vertigo of an inescapable simulation.‚Äù

Best-case scenario: ‚Äúemergent forms of post-digital individual and collective sense-making spreading on a massive scale.‚Äù

2. CAPABILITY CRISIS (HOW CAN IT BE DONE?):

‚ÄúIncapacity at the level of operating on the world intelligently. In all social positions and domains of work, individuals are increasingly unable to engage in problem- solving to the degree needed for continued social integration.‚Äù

Worst-case scenario: ‚Äúresults in catastrophic infrastructure failure due to a brain-power shortage.‚Äù

Best-case scenario: ‚Äúrevivification of guilds and technical educational initiatives for a new economics of social system integration.‚Äù

3. LEGITIMACY CRISIS (WHO SHOULD DO IT?):

‚ÄúIncoherence at the level of cultural agreements. Political and bureaucratic forms of power are failing to provide sufficiently convincing rationale and justification for trust in their continued authority.‚Äù

Worst-case scenario: ‚Äúcomplete citizen-level defection from all organised political bodies.‚Äù

Best-case scenario: ‚Äúnew forms of governance and collective choice-making that are built out from first principles, factoring in dynamics that are digital and planetary.‚Äù

4. MEANING CRISIS (WHY DO IT?):

‚ÄúInauthenticity at the level of personal experience. Individuals from all walks of life are questioning the purpose of their existence, the goodness of the world, and the value of ethics, beauty, and truth.‚Äù "Crisis of 'we'"

Worst-case scenario: ‚Äúpeak alienation and a total mental health crisis.‚Äù

Best-case scenario: ‚Äúdemocratisation of enlightenment, sanity and psychological sovereignty.‚Äù

======Active Inference context======

Humanity superorganism is a system made out of nested interacting systems (governing parts, social groups), active inference agent preserved by a nested hiearchy/hetearchy/anarchy of markov blankets corresponding to different concrete (governing institution) or abstract (subculture) substructures.   

Sense-making === Confusion at the level of understanding the nature of the world. System making for survival and flourishing insufficient models of its internal (understanding how society operates) and external (understanding how nature operates) dynamics by falling into overfitting (too specialized) or underfitting (too general) or freeze responce (not doing anything) failure modes or not having enough computational power to train an accurate representation (unable to comprehend increasing complexity) or not directing modelling power to important areas (ignoring because of short term local interests or just being clueless)

Capability crisis === Incapacity at the level of operating on the world intelligently. Not enough coordinated action states to act inside various active inference subagents informed by efficient internal hidden (sense making) states (unable to engage in problem with specific efficient solutions) (solving to the degree needed for continued social integration), not taking in account long term consequences in time (not deep enough policies) or what destructive or maladaptive domino effects (interconnectedness of global crises and influences) (cascading causal influence in the network) it might cause inside or outside the system

Legitimacy crisis === Incoherence at the level of cultural agreements. Culture is defined by shared language, when there are asymmetric frameworks of beliefs that when interacting generate inneficient message passing with lots of friction (leading to loss of important information) and inability to reduce uncertainity between governing and laymen clusters of people, result is tension, absence of reinforced dependence and connection (resulting in agents being mutually unsatisfied resulting in mutual distrust)

Meaning crisis === Inauthenticity at the level of personal experience. Nonexistent implemented efficient collective scientific (natural sciences) (outside world) and psychological (spiritual) (inside world) uncertainity reduction protocol (metamodern culture of connection) leading to discoordinated local interaction of mutually incompatible disconnected agents with different fundamental priors (science vs spirituality instead of being together, corporations maximizing for limbic hijacking addictivity, corporations not aligned with governing intitutions not aligned with communities of people that are also not connected by something deeper, leading to too much of ingroup outgroup competition (above the healthy limit) instead of collective problem solving as humanity), absence of shared goal space and objective functions, inability to explore uncertain realms because of too much order leading to overfitting (too high mental specialization aka canalization leading to inability to see entropic beauty in everything, being stuck in one's perspective, leading to inability for empathy (psychopathic ethics), inability for theory of mind leading to inability for connection and collective uncertainity reducing goal states, leading to collective hopelessness (brains having action states crisis) and fear about future)


Ecological === system (humanity) destroying useful negentropy generator functions in the environment by planning short term instead of long term

===Unified literature in the context of Active Inference===

Society as nested active inference agents compromising one big active inference agent.

===More thoughts===

My biggest unknown is: What are the most effective interventions to our system that will a) increase the wellbeing of human population, b) increase collective efficient mitigation and resolving of symptoms and causes of risks and crises and c) making efficient material and psychological (that complement eachother) progress leading to flourishing. And how all those factors interconnect. How to make them respect, support and check eachother instead of fighting violently.

From the perspective of moral responsibility for all current and future generations and looking at current climate reports I would say we need to globally as humanity act more to minimize the acceleration and existing destructive effects of climate change as the current priority (you also have other crisises like mental health, loneliness, energy crisis, overall metacrisis with sensemaking, education etc., or potential risks including nuclear, pandemics, nanoweapons, bioweapons, artificial intelligence (full of lots of perspectives), volcanoes,...). The current coordination doesn't seem to be enough to address the increasing negative climate change statistics and the metacrisis when we look at the current statistics. What are the current core causes of the climate problems? Corporations with big power capital having the most systemic influence maximizing profits short term individually (as in, not caring about the whole humanity), caring just for themselves in polarized competetive dynamics. What are the solutions? What strategies do we have? Spread the message? Fixing symptoms such as carbon extraction from athmosphere, polution extraction, helping biosphere in other ways? Fixing its causes? Make cheaper and better green technologies in science and practice? We can transform the internal structure of the corporations. Use peaceful cooperative dialog in attempt to transform them? Science lecture inside them? Beat them economically by winning over them in competition? Create less psychopathic more compassionate and more globally morally caring corporations winning over them. Make green technologies more economically viable. Use language of money more? Use economical and political pressure on those psychopathic agents. Santions? Altruistic financing? Use civil unrest pressure. Or damage them? Use violence? Or erase them? I understand Eliezer bombing GPU clusters to minimize unaligned AGI risk.

Systemic revolution of steering our humanity superorganism away from selftermination with those cancerous cells slowly killing its host into a system not based on such strong psychopathic competetion? Attempt to rebuild society on collective meaning? But would that be enough force to stop the current strongest cancerous power structures screwing it up for everyone? Strenghten regulations? Strenghten global top down governance such as United Nations? That will create civil unrest from the psychopathic people and corperations (which already happens a lot), but if language of cooperation and peaceful dialog isnt enough, what then is enough? Are AI technologies accelerating it even more? Certain degree of competetion and arms races is evolutionary good and has certain advantages, like technological innovation, but too much of it leads us to those multipolar traps. Is peace enough? Is violence needed? Could violence lead to accelerated selftermination and disconnection instead of cultivation of culture of connection and harmony and resolving conflicting parts not aligned with the collective wellbeing? We dont want opression like in Russia, or chaos like in Somalia, we want something third that benefits the longterm wellbeing of humanity! Strong education about all of this? Culture of compassion and connection? Liquid democracy? Communes? Degrowth? What are other possible strategies? What are the most optimal combinations of those strategies to create the chances of the most efficient collective long term wellbeing, survival and flourishing? All of attempts individually add up into one giant force of care for all current and future generations! I believe we will succeed when we join forces together effectively!

Raw capitalism creates an evolutionary pressure/incentive/objective function of raw profits, incentives that go against what feels good to most people. Money on money dynamics even more. You can use top down restrictions to maximize chances of collective survival, increase collective long term wellbeing and meaning, but its not given that governing structure will be aligned with values of people, wellbeing etc., so it needs to be checked via for example multiple governing structures or ideally by democracy. To avoid lots of meaning and wellbeing and theory of governance issues when electing, we need education of people in those issues, not being stuck in one world view with focused attention, aligning values of the governing parts with the layman compatible with wellbeing/risks science. Power check and reduce psychopathic agents by culture of connection and compassion? Gene editing to enhance compassion? Can laymen people even be systematically thaught these complex topics, is that realistic? Or is the only solution some strong enough evolutionary pressure on the structue of the system from wellbeing, existencial risk, etc. scientists? Some kind or technocracy? That needs power and corruption checking too. How to approximately evaluate expertise to minimize psychopathic agents? Some academic system that isnt as broken as current academic system? And who checks that? Some metascientists/metagovernaning structures? Who checks that? Do we need antimoloch God under everything tonescape this loop? How to avoid psychopathic evolutionary pressures? Is centralized power fundamentally doomed? Degrowth? Decentralized independent donbar number communes only? Does that halt collective action against for example climate change? How to prevent tribal wars? Is that even possible with current total interdependence? Does current system halt efficient collective action as well? Somewhere yes in some problems (EU climate) somewhere not (USA) (collective sensemaking and wellbeing), but not globally, and we have the metacrisis. Can gametheoretically stable "ideal" system equivalent to benevolent illuminati Gods controling everything for long term survival and wellbeing of the people even exist? There is also issue of plurality of existing moral/ethical etc. systems. Respect or try to reform those dynamics or some middle way? There is also the issue of plurality of models of wellbeing and risks and that also come from plularity of values. Can we synthetize them? Create evolutionary selection dynamics between them measured by their success? Minimize friction between them in an ecosystem where they interact? How about plurality of methods quantifying and measuring success? All this prediction and measuring stuff also takes tons of computational power and complexity that might be incomprehensible, we must approximate and select various comprehensible factors like in climate science. What are the best approximator factors to look for in the system? We're back at the issue of plurality. If we go from theory back to practice and editing what we already have, how to create the most efficient set of evolutionary pressures to steer the current system's structure more towards wellbeing and risk mitigation? Strengthten effective altruism education and influence?

Excess of competition/rivarly and order is behind the metacrisis?

Different people speak with different fundamental languages determining their actions so if one wants to change their action one should synchronize with their objective functions. Politics is a lot about the language of power. Corporations speak the language of money. Language of values. Language of morality. Language of meaningful experiences and meaning in general. Supercooperators are the golden nugget against the metacrisis. What are the best evolutionary pressures for supercooperation clusters? Compassion, psychedelics, meditation, unity, opposite of polarization, nonduality? Could massemailing people that have the biggest causal influence in determining humanity's trajectory while synchronizing as most as possible with their language lead to efficient evolutionary pressure towards a good third attractor? What else is needed to make strong enough good evolutionary pressure in the evolution of societal architecture?

The current economic system was a solution to no wars happening after WW2, where growth was not mediated by war but by exponentially growing GDP of economies, which might be breaking now with exponential extraction of resources that replenish linearly and Russia is under such pressure which results in it attacking Ukraine.

Or would it accelerate as their tense hatred of EU/USA etc. and need for annihilation could be used realized more efficiently? Or are sanctions strong enough to kill all their power to conquer?

Human intelligence not being bound by wisdom, where wisdom is seeing and setting goals and acting from the point of wholeness (planetary collective moral awareness) instead of from the point of parts, is the core driver of metacrisis we are facing.
AI in the context of Moloch.
AI in the hands of profit maxxing corporations with monopolies of economical and overall power over population with goals that are narrow, local and short term is a good idea.
Narrow AI is accelerant of biowep/cyberwep and other existencial risks.

Is money inherently broken system as liquid tokem with reduction of complexity and implicit asymmetries not accounting for externalities? 
Activism and lobbying into good actors in this hiearhical process to make destructive actions or actions with externalities less profitable and morally right to make economic incentive for the right kinds of actions in terms of minimizing Molochian dynamics. Closing the unsustainable loops inside economy that lead to pollution. Trees maintain the ecosystem's soil, many things live there, it interacts with water sources etc. and we dont even fully know how it works and by lumber extraction we get marginal local game theoretic advantage but potentially millions of dollars in terms of damage in the long term in terms of floods and extreme weather events or droughts or general ecosystem loss that we dont tend to factor, we affect suff that is in the unknown set that we cant fully measure because of its big interconnectivity and complexity and predictively chaotic behavior. 
Overall biological systems do holistic interconnected computations across scales that evolutionarily evovled by tons of natural selection and thats why they're so good at computing and plastic and unpredictable while our artificial machines predictively exploit just mostly one scale and one type of computation.

direct problem as a consequence:

existing agents benefiting themselves short term instead of long term for everyone driving climate change and exponential social media addictive tech destroying mental health meaning and so on

The answer to all of the problems is all of the solutions, I believe many solutions should to be more deployed synergetically more than the current attempts to make collective survival and flourishing more probable. I'm deeply optimistic the collective efforts across solutions will be enough, which is both optimistic prediction and fueling motivation for changing stuff for the better, as the opposite counterfactual implies hopelessness and doom and decreases chances of things actually getting better if people have that belief. Collective beliefs are both predicting and forming the future. 

Good future will happen! Darwinian bonds will be transcended. Consciousness will flourish. QRI is the key player for reverseengineering consciousness. There will be infinite bliss gradients in game theoretically stable system undestroyable by petrubations. Let's make this happen collectively. Reverseengineering consciousness and universe. Beating Replicators. Beating Moloch. Optimism is not only justified, it's a fight for a higher future.

solutions: attempting to change the existing monopoly corporate giant's inner structure by enforcing wellbeing research into what they maximize (add values to the objective functions of facebook more [MEANING ALIGNMENT INSTITUTE]([MEANING ALIGNMENT INSTITUTE]([MEANING ALIGNMENT INSTITUTE]([MEANING ALIGNMENT INSTITUTE]([MEANING ALIGNMENT INSTITUTE](https://meaningalignment.org/))))) ) but also understanding their goals with compassion and economic incentives (slowly transform corporate mindfullness into deep compassion traditions by lecturing and practicing it?) will this be enough though, how to change the global maladaptive evolutionary economical incentives, are they centralized in corporates and psychopathic people with giant amount of power or distributed emergent dynamics from noncompassionate society and tons of generational trauma generating endless trust issues and driving disconnection crisis? how to direct psychopathic economic incentives into nonpsychopathic ones?? attempt at slow cultural transformation?? the fact that the cultural divide seems to be exponentially accelerating doesnt seem to be nice

One can model fuzzy Markov blankets, where degree of fuzzyness is index as inner product of hessian and senesoidal flow being 0 in an idealized Markov blanket. 
As system size increases, it tends to go to zero with 100% probability, creating higher order blankets.

Current state of the world - psychopathic power structure thinking locally and short term are dominating, inhabiting coopration against global long term crisis that whole humanity faces

Force the change of their internal workings

Create new ones that outcompete them, or merge with them through cooperation and make them less psychopathic (competition leads to psychopathy tho)

What do we want? Reduce uncertainity about our basic needs and (evolutionary pressured by nature plus nurture) learned goals driven by values (minimize Active Inference agent's free energy (decrease dissonance) of objective functions pretrained by evolution or culture or individual inquiry in interconnected societal system). Evolution pretrained us to automatically depend on others in family, community, culture, nation state etc. That's broken by genes correlating with psychopathy combined with environmental influences such as for example pollution, inflamation, or depending uncertainity minimizing mutual agent to agent bond being unsuccesful and thus breaking, leading to feeling hurt and cascading trust issues leading to asymmetries and rivalious dynamics and isolation and alienation and individualization of the agent or clusters of agents in their social graph in relation to mimimizing uncertainity about basic needs, leading to loneliness and dissolution of motivation for collective synchronized sensemaking and shared goals to survive and flourish collectively, which can is fixable by strong enough evidence that bonding is worth it to satisfy basic needs and goals collectively by compatible language or action. Leaders do collective uncertainity reduction this at scale.

How to fix any problem:

Locate and name maladative symtoms (surface processes) and the core generating functions (cause) those symtoms.

Find and apply methods of fixing both symtoms and the core generator functions such that collapse of the system's stability doesn't happen by mathematical theory's derivation from the system's laws (regularities in time) or by experimenting.

Spread solutions throught the system by efficient massage passing and incetivize parts to cooperate on solving this problem. 

In the spacial case of the meaning crisis - Find what you're best at: theoretical research, practical research in different scientific fields, engineering, accounting, working with people, spreading solutions - and do that, ideally do what isnt done enough yet, where work towards survival and flourishing is missing.

Succesful leaders install local and global objective functions into agents, giving oportunities for pleasant error reduction gradients, creating goal alignment, resolving power or belief asymmetries that lead to conflicts via finding common ground, make efficient selforganization

We need more efficient leaders reducing population's uncertainity by speech with realistic models and incentivizing people to actions that increase collective chances of survival and future flourishing, giving people sense of meaning and sense of connectedness with the collective

Many leaders with slightly different fundamental assumptions emerge, but with the same intention of unifying people to survive and flourish. Could metaleaders aligning existing leader's languages help?

Could the underlying crisis of metacrisis be interpreted as valence crisis as a sign of dying humanity superorganism? Possibly too pesimistic interpretation. More like tons of before differianted human superorganisms attempting to merge together as their markov blanket boundaries dissolve together thanks to the internet, will we do it succesfully? Are we witnessing the statistical merging of Europe, then merging of Europe with America and rest of the world, is China succesfully stable markov blanket on its own? 

We need optimal amount of both cooperative generalists and competing specialists in society

When they're helping their tribe, or ingroup in general, unless you're a psychopath, and according to some researchers, psychopathy is on the rise. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/surviving-the-female-psychopath/202206/does-psychopathy-begin-us Where's the problem? I doubt genetic profile has changed, let's look into environmental factors. A lot of people report not being satisfied with their job, not seeing meaning in it, such as for example soul numbing corporate jobs, living from paycheck to paycheck. We need to feel connected to the collective and feel like we're doing good for it. This is the loneliness/interconnectedness crisis. We must cultivate a culture of connection to fix this. There are so many asymmetries in cultural dynamics killing this. Instead of making money for overly rich boss that's not altruistic, we wanna feel like adding value to our ingroup directly. This makes sense evolutionary, as this is the conditions we mostly evolved in. 

If i feel like burning out, i do literally nothing (exact superresting meditation technique) and remind myself why I'm doing this for further motivation for a day

Conflicts are the result of (overly) confident mutually asymmetric beliefs creating friction by selfevidencing attempts interaction increasing tension leading to blow up

christianity is so evolutionarily fit in the evoltuionary dnyamics of cultural frameworks because it implements high valence structures (God as reality loves you) and spreads by converting or annihilating those who dont believe (treat others as you wanna be treated: if you didnt believe in god, you would want others to convert or annihilate you in this framework) [Thinking through other minds: A variational approach to cognition and culture - PubMed]([Thinking through other minds: A variational approach to cognition and culture - PubMed]([Thinking through other minds: A variational approach to cognition and culture - PubMed]([Thinking through other minds: A variational approach to cognition and culture - PubMed]([Thinking through other minds: A variational approach to cognition and culture - PubMed]([Thinking through other minds: A variational approach to cognition and culture - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31142395/))))))

Radical going to the deepest source of any problem possible combined with radical empathy seems to be the best kind of problem solving method. Sometimes you can only heal symptoms, sometimes its too late, sometimes you can change whole future iterations of the system by changing its deepest pattern generator functions.

I think many of the individual solutions to the metacrisis can be modelled as fundamental and everything downstream from that, many thinkers ended up with that in their model, but I think they're all partial. I tend to be often on the side that education is one of the strongest factors that should be enhanced and many things downstream from it. There are many methods to achieve that for example, I'm slowly mapping them out. You can try to get people with lots of power on your side (those that have causal power over how education is realized) for example and try to speak as much as possible their language and incetivize positive change via dialog, money, contribution etc. 
Or for example if you have wealthy people or government destroying rainforests, here you can talk their language by appealing to the fact that it kills climate and ecosystems leading to crop failures leading to food scarity leading to internal instability of angry people thats hard to govern and costs lots of money.
I would say its about finding where you have the highest chances, as an individual, or as a collective. Many movements are attempting to do the many reforms already, so supporting those, finding what actors are more likely to get on your side, etc. Science communication about these problems.
Some friction will almost always happen. I would say it's about minimizing it. Sometimes only confrontation prevents long term harm. Sometimes too much confrontation can be counterproductive instead. Being too radical might end up damaging somewhere, but might be good somewhere. Depends a lot on the current problem space I would argue. 
Some issues with deep roots will probably need much more radical changes, I agree. Redesigning how current money mechanism and its physics works by changing it into something different that doesnt generate as much perverse incentives by for example less reductivity - that would require lots of big changes. 
I would argue it all lives on a spectrum. From changing slightly what is to extreme changes. I would say its about finding what is the best middle way.
I believe current dynamics will be changed by all the various movements attempting to change for the better on this spectrum. 
As an individual I attempt to be as effective agent as possible by so far mostly learning about all these things and communicating them and I want to do more educating. I am/plan to join more forces with various other people attempting to help all of this. I wish one person could help all of it at the same time, but that's impossible. Strenghtening collective effort in all the various problem landscapes is big part of it. Hopefully the collective acceleration will in good direction and strong enough. I can do only so much as one agent that is attempting to help this. Attempt at (automated?) mass education is one way. 
There are various analysis methods for calculating how impactful your intervention can be from Effective Altruism etc. [Four modes of thinking about cause prioritization | by Jakub Simek | Giving On The Edge | Medium]([Four modes of thinking about cause prioritization | by Jakub Simek | Giving On The Edge | Medium]([Four modes of thinking about cause prioritization | by Jakub Simek | Giving On The Edge | Medium](https://medium.com/giving-on-the-edge/four-modes-of-thinking-about-cause-prioritization-8b9f81abd6b0)))

Principled Societies Project [Principled Societies Project Home]([Principled Societies Project Home]([Principled Societies Project Home]([Principled Societies Project Home]([Principled Societies Project Home](https://principledsocietiesproject.org/))))) 

‚ÄúA society can be viewed as a superorganism that expresses an intrinsic purpose of achieving and maintaining vitality. The systems of a society can be viewed as a societal cognitive architecture. The goal of the R&D program is to develop new, integrated systems that better facilitate societal cognition (i.e., learning, decision making, and adaptation). Our major unsolved problems, like climate change and biodiversity loss, can be viewed as symptoms of dysfunctional or maladaptive societal cognition. To better solve these problems, and to flourish far into the future, we can implement systems that are designed from the ground up to facilitate healthy societal cognition.
The proposed R&D project represents a partnership between the global science community, interested local communities, and other interested parties. In concept, new systems are field tested and implemented in local communities via a special kind of civic club. Participation in a club is voluntary, and only a small number of individuals (roughly, 1,000) is needed to start a club. No legislative approval is required in most democratic nations. Clubs are designed to grow in size and replicate to new locations exponentially fast‚Äù

Getting enlightened is about "looking" for the sources of thermodynamic symmetry breakings aka concrete restricting categorizing knotty sector dividing structure generators and dissolving them this  way including the global asymmetry of the looker, doer and perciever in a spacetime with a center until none of those structures are generated anymore and there's almost no more global stressing and resistance to the flow of energy and annealing tends to do this implicitly also in the subconscious processes and sometimes making them conscious giving the ability to manipulate with them consciouly.

Experience is made of lighcones - local self and global attention arrows, awareness itself constructing space and time. Turn those lightcones to themselves or to eachother until "start" and "end" gets so correlated that it explodes into a bubble or into entropic structurelessness. 

All structure can be dissolved by underfitting rewriting, overwhelming explosion, irrelevance destabilization, or not giving it attention overtime that it dies unsupported on its own.

How do you conceptualize states of consciousness with the absence of spacetime? I Andres' description in this video, but I feel like there should be more to explain, can we ground it in more models? I want to see a fundamental physics model that explains spacetime in experience. (here's memory in quantum field theory https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437122003016 ) Or how about a fundamental physics model that doesnt assume spacetime like quantum field theory does? 

Since my last 5-MeO-DMT trip with experience of "extremely intensely" "mindblowing" (compared to other trips or meditation) experience of no spacetime (or any structure in general), that was probably my best experience in my life, it made me extremely curious to understand the nature behind it!

How linked is phenomenal and physical spacetime? Can phenomenal spacetime emerge from physical emergent spacetime? Or other way around? Or is it one thing? In order to account for beyond spacetime experience, should use models beyond spacetime? If physical spacetime is emergent from entaglement, is phenomenal spacetime emergent from brain's binding that kind of acts like entaglement since it supports phenomenal spacetime? Could we use holographic principle maths there?

Can phenomenal spacetimeless states of consciousness be like cessations classically modelled as disintegration of brain's message passing activity? https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0079612322001984 Inhibition of memory saving mental faculties? Dissolving, smoothening lots of thermodynamic global symmetry breakings creating concrete sectors of qualia? How to model it in fundamental physics that goes beyond classical mechanistic functional notions of the brain with (relativistic) spacetime? Is phenomenal spacetimeless totally random points of view from different parts of the topological pocket leading to chaotic interfering cancelling out of different paths, getting total dissonant or consonant symmetrical global harmony (in my case it was always the consonant case)? Did the dynamics inside the topological pocket's boundary normally corresponding to fieldlike behavior of superposition of all possible paths just turned into absolute chaotic breakdown with alien inner or outer shape and edge cases where no stable emergent classical patterns had any chance to survive through darwinian selection of pointer states ([Quantum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum)_Darwinism ) and spacetime as error correcting code glue had no chances of functioning correctly, no more sense of screen and spacetime from every possible path within the pocket? How about the binding problem, are spacetime fields of consciousness emergent from something deeper to account for states of consciousness without spacetime? Can topological boundaries really be frameinvariant in nonlocal frameworks or models that don't work with spacetime or have it fundamentally as possibly relativistic/relational emergent phenomena? Is the pocket emergent (possibly as a result also relativistic? could relativity here imply a kind of frameinvariantness though?) from deeper mathematical fundamental physics structures? (amplituhdron, loop quantum gravity, holographic principle, quantum darwinism, quantum FEP etc. I mentioned earlier?) Can we mathematically reduce it futher, making fundamental (almost) nothing concrete that aligns with our intution? 

Or maybe dissolution of topological pocket's boundary disintegrating it a one subjective experience in spacetime unit? Here the sense of evolution of contents in a topological boundary seems to break down. But only "I" "have" this "memory" in our relativistic shared physical and dynamical phenomenal spacetime, or is it the case that space and time and sense of individuality are fundamentally all ontologically an "illusion"? Is reality totally beyond structure? But we still want to predict it? What's the minimal predictive transcendental mathematical structure of reality? Can this be grasped in QRI's physicalist ontology, such that those states could be neuroengineered with predictive explanatory empirical scientific models, and explaining neurophenomenology of 5-MeO-DMT more? Neuroengineering someone's neurophenomenological physical state beyond phenomenal spacetime using someone else's phenomenal spacetime! Many questions! Are they answerable? Are they just neverending unanswerable Zen koans? Nature of reality! Fun!

==Exploring the nature of physical reality's deepest structure==

My message to Chris Fields [Chris Fields Research](https://chrisfieldsresearch.com/)

I still have questions about free energy principle for generic quantum systems. I am attempting to merge it with quantum darwinism applied to subatomic particles. This is my current understanding and I might have made mistakes in learning, feel free to correct me:

We start with axioms: time symmetry and nonchanging physics.
We start with general definition of entaglement: nonseparability of one system into two
That's enough for a theory to be considered quantum?
And noncommutativity of measurments?
We're made of complex numbered wave functions for subatomic particles interacting and entangling with eachother, do we use that as general arbitrary quantum system? [- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==p7bzE1E5PMY) Does any classical information that we can measure, such as momentum or velocity, corresponding to an exact mathematical operator? How about a classical bayesian belief? Is it qubits read by quantum reference frames all the way down? Or can we instead of the quantum wavefunction use any general (quantum) (probabilistic) differential equation now on different scales? 
General definition of classical information: measurable properies of pointer states that are quantum eqivalent of classical states that went through decoherence's natural selection (measurable location, spin, momentum, bit, some classical comprehensible property that isnt just a wavefunction in general?).
Spacetime can be seen as glued by entaglement doing quantum error correction by holographic principle - more entaglement -> less distance, less local energy, globally further in time.
Human perception is entaglement through linguistic contextual relativism. Mental processes are relational aka entangle to make a unitary experience.
Binding is information theoretically entaglement by nonseparability of mental processes, of qualia bound to the phenomenal field and relational, you get holistic field computing.
They might be nonentagled particles, but the whole experience is nonseparable fundamentally, but we can separate part of our experience and that also kind of goes through decoherence into classical information (decoherence is lost of relationality, loss of globality).
Entaglement is kind of like emergence here.
Topological pocket implies classical spacetime's "objective" relativistic location pointer state. [Frontiers | Don‚Äôt forget the boundary problem!

Or by quantum coherence? (neuronal superpositions)
Spacetime emerging from entaglement now seems to work on both global physical and local neurophenomenological level.
If you can separate a brain dynamics into two fundamentally disconnected systems, how can there be one unified experience? And you still cannot really disconnect it from the environment - here we get emergence of shared culture and universe that all computes relationally, never in isolation. You cannot separate, explain our experience without taking in account our environment that its trained on, that it models, that it reflects, that it works with evolutionarily dynamically adaptively! Or can you, are artificial neural nets working in isolation, or is their information also fundamentally relational and nonseparable to its training data set? But because its not entaglement (nonseparability, relationality, binding) in our shared physical space that would generate space, or that its not implemented as a topological binding into one segment in the EM field, it doesnt create unified experience in spacetime? The unified topological information processing needs to be nonseparable system in our shared spacetime? Or it doesnt need to be? Do they have their own spacetime? Is it arbitary, are both observing quantum reference frames as long as its dynamics correspond to a cocone diagram, a markov blanket? Any statistically unified information processing? Why the quantum - because we're using mathematics of quantum theory - entagling (making nonseparable) general physical quantum systems. It also gives us bayesian coherence, correlation, conditional dependence (it giving information? it having causal influence?). If so, is this how substrate independent information processing agents will merge their experiences into unified global mind's experience? [- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==2JW_anywYn8)

Is reality qubits read by quantum reference frames with bayesian cocone diagrams with spacetime and perception as entanglement and classical information as measurable properies of pointer states that are quantum equivalents of classical states that went through decoherence's natural selection all the way down? 

Second explanation:

Entaglement is statistical nonseparability of one system into many. [[2112.15242] A free energy principle for generic quantum systems]([[2112.15242] A free energy principle for generic quantum systems]([[2112.15242] A free energy principle for generic quantum systems]([[2112.15242] A free energy principle for generic quantum systems]([[2112.15242] A free energy principle for generic quantum systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15242))))) [- YouTube]([- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==aeh9bSuSNrA)) 

In quantum darwinism we have pointer states, the quantum equivalents of the classical states of the system after decoherence has occurred through interaction with the environment that survived in darwinian natural selection, leading to loss of quantum entaglement, transforming quantum information into classical information. Spacetime and gravity are part of the classical state. [Quantum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum)_Darwinism 

Let's suppose quantum reference frame (QRF) A corresponds to organism A and QRF B to organism B. Let's suppose those QRFs' cone-cocone diagrams are implemented by the brain dynamics, that are fundamentally modelled by quantum darwinism describing potential entangling of subatomic particles (or arbitrary quantum systems in general that can be classical pointer states), and approximated by various quantum field theory, neural field theory, or any other classical or quantum models used in neuroscience, neurophysiology, neurobiology, biophysics, quantum biology and overall consciousness studies. [Quantum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum)_mind#Quantum_brain_dynamics [On Connectome and Geometric Eigenmodes of Brain Activity: The Eigenbasis of the Mind?]([On Connectome and Geometric Eigenmodes of Brain Activity: The Eigenbasis of the Mind?]([On Connectome and Geometric Eigenmodes of Brain Activity: The Eigenbasis of the Mind?]([Qualia Research Institute](https://qri.org/)blog/eigenbasis-of-the-mind))) 

The leading theories of consciousness think that brain corresponds to a quantum system that mostly works classicaly, they suppose that brain doesn't really do mainly pure quantum computing (on the level of particles), but instead mostly classical computing, because assuming it (particles) was entangled, it would quickly locally decohere because of too much environmental interaction (even tho globally there's one universal wavefunction where nothing ever happens [[1210.8447] Nothing happens in the Universe of the Everett Interpretation]([[1210.8447] Nothing happens in the Universe of the Everett Interpretation]([[1210.8447] Nothing happens in the Universe of the Everett Interpretation]([[1210.8447] Nothing happens in the Universe of the Everett Interpretation]([[1210.8447] Nothing happens in the Universe of the Everett Interpretation]([[1210.8447] Nothing happens in the Universe of the Everett Interpretation]([[1210.8447] Nothing happens in the Universe of the Everett Interpretation]([[1210.8447] Nothing happens in the Universe of the Everett Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.8447)))))))) and according to quantum cognition there's entaglement between mental processes and between organisms, which is formalizing contextuality while communicating [Quantum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum)_cognition ), and this being the reason why our current built quantum computers must be in really close to absolute zero to maintain stable entaglement. [Quantum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum)_mind But quantum computing on the level of particles might play just a small role in the function with some empirically measured entanglement. (nuclear proton spins of 'brain water' being entangled) [Experimental indications of non-classical brain functions - IOPscience]([ShieldSquare Captcha]([ShieldSquare Captcha]([ShieldSquare Captcha](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2399-6528/ac94be)))) Therefore, according to quantum darwinism, its a physical quantum state with subatomic particles with a lot of internal separable classical pointer states. 

My main question is:
When communication between those two systems (organisms) through entaglement happens, which is the basis for perception, do we put in a quantum superposition a system that is separable (QRF A) with another separable system (QRF B), making the resulting system nonseparable, resulting in quantum entaglement? Do all the before separable states in the QRFs become unseparable, because the two QRFs become one quantum superposition? Will that cause the entangled system to have the properties of quantum computing (time symmetry), instead of classical computing? How do these properties manifest in concrete situations? Contextuality of our language? Is there time symmetry in our language? What are the best empirical examples? Nonseparability of symbols in language or bayesian beliefs present among cultures?

When it comes to sight, what does the classical content of our visual field (holographic screen) correspond to, what system/s do we entangle with? Photons? Or emitters of those photons (sun)? Or with the system they bounce off from (chair)? All of it, because without this photon bouncing process, or without the object, or without the whole univserse, there wouldn't be us, which is fundamental contextuality of everything? But its good enough pragmatically to make classical approximations to predict quantum states that behave classicaly, where time symmetry doesn't seem to be really utilized locally, while being utilized globally everywhere? How does sound work? How do other senses work?

Is the communication between the nested holographic quantum reference frames in our neuroanatomy also realized via the same kind of entaglement? Contextuality of mental processes? [OSF]([OSF]([OSF](https://psyarxiv.com/6afs3)))

What do phenomenal states, where sense of spacetime or existence stops existing (on disorders of consciousness, deep sleep, deep meditation, psychedelics) correspond to the loss of entaglement? Is all qualia classical? If all perception is relation entaglement with other quantum systems, would that mean that our holographic screen could "measure" the existence/correlates with quantum states that don't behave classicaly? Are there "quantum qualia" corresponding to quantum information? Does that make sense mathematically?

Are elementary particles the best fundamental building blocks to use in quantum darwinism, since quantum field theory models the universe as system of interacting quantized fields, where particles are just excitations of the fields?

How to think about bayesian networks minimizing free energy without appealing to some update function that assumes time, because space and time is classical information embedded inside the network? Because it is encoded as entaglement error correcting glue, we just describe slice in time by the total amount of global entaglement and interaction is defined as all the possible paths in the free energy landscape, that is mathematically equivalent to quantum theory's by default universal wavefunction, one fully entangled globally spacetimeless system where spacetime just makes sense locally?

I vibe with qualia research institute's and quantum free energy principles's ontology and try to unify them - mental is physical - physics models are also consciousness models, that approximate the substrate of physics that is the substrate of consciousness and help us predict it - quantum field theory, quantum darwinism, spacetime from entaglement, quantum loop gravity, holographic principle, quantum formulation of the free energy principle, or other fundamental physics models, or other quantum or classical models used in physics and modelling consiousness - whatever you choose and synthetize, its also describing consciousness, and individual experience in a qFEP's quantum reference frame implemented as bound by neural synchrony or quantum coherence (neuronal superpositions) or QRI's topologically segmented pocket in the EM field or other solutions or some synthesis of those.

The question if we can construct a physics theory that can predict everything in total accuracy is also deep, because we're local observers with finite modelling capacity and computational power (bounded rationality), but its the best we got, so assuming unity of underlying physical substrate with topological fieldlike information theoretic dynamics being substrate of consciousness that we approximate with various unifying physics models is IMO the best we can assume for doing science, aka creating predictive models that give us the agency to manipulate reality with technologies or psychotechnologies derived from them.

From global universal wavefunction of reality made of one nonseparable unified entangled system we locally emerge into spacetime with quantum system contents with evolutionarily competing separable classical pointer states in the process of decoherence with quantum reference frames corresponding to quantum systems processing information and percieving and modelling and acting communicating via entaglement and getting closer to eachother in space via increasing entanglement overtime.

So, if we wanna describe all natural scientific fields in one model using the quantum formulation of the free energy principle or overall quantum information theory and fundamental physics, we can use it to formalize the fundamental relationality of information in any other scientific discipline that studies arbitrary quantum systems that may or may not have classical correspondences in various models, where all models are useful approximations and evolutionary niches.

too open and one dissolves into entropy aka entaglement.
are mental processes that are kept classically an entaglement network with those mutual agreements. 
but on psychedelics explode to even more entropy<->entaglement through all the open quantum subsystems becoming even more open, more correlated. 
its higher order entaglement, not just concrete particle entaglement (that might be minimal). 
is generalized universal wavefunction universal statespace of all possible statespaces. 
when we measure a particle we isolate it from the universal wavefunction not taking in account its entaglement with everything but getting information on that scale that is kept there via it being a pointer state aka mutual agreement in the entaglement network replicated everywehre in the network
its von neumann entropy 0 for the universal wavefunction but its bigger for its subsystems because its the quantum state equivalent to classical state so we get classical probability possibilities of outcomes of measurments.
in quantum computers we need to disentagle particles from its environment to get only isolated internal stable entaglement for computing that isnt interefered by explosive entagling decoherence with the environment. 
entaglement is just correlation between open quantum systems slowly killing its boundaries.
any quantum thermodynamic nonqeuilibrium steady state is kept at bay by resisting entropy aka entaglement by internal error code correction.
the more open the more entagled the more fuzzy.

or the overall evolution of concept of entropy (disorder) is fascinating.
i love how shannon entropy is special case of it according to Neumann.
its generalization of thermodynamic entropy into information theory.
amount of hidden information in a system.
apparently Neumann told Shannon to call it entropy as he didnt realize it. üòÑ
one way to think of it is the more possible outcomes an event has, the more Shannon entropy it has.
Von Neumann entropy generalizes it to the quantum and its the heart of quantum information theory.
whole wavefunction of two entagled particles has von neuman entropy 0 because the wavefunction  has all the information about the system you can gather
but the isolated entangled particle has von neumann entropy bigger than 0 since there's hidden information in the rest of the wavefunction, making its entropy equivalent to classical particle.
in statistical mechanics i like the connection that more entropy leads to more possible configurations of the system and therefore more information is contained in it.
entropy is life!

==Nature of base reality and truth==

https://imgur.com/a/7j10oMk

Can we even "reach" "base reality"? Is it comprehensible? Do we think about base reality "correctly"? Does he question of "base reality" even make sense"?

But I agree that scientifically all our models can be seen as useful approximations of some dynamics out there that predict and make sense of tons of empirical data with various explanatory power, is it all just our brains fitting curves like in machine learning all the way down? Let's construct the most predictive and explanatory and unifying model of reality as possible!

I trust and use the scientific method the most out of any other epistemological frames as nothing is as pragmatic for understanding (predicting and manipulating) the mind, physics and the world overall. I'm just openminded to explore all other ways of conceptualizing truth and also love getting my mind expanded by all the possibilities of looking at reality and I lvoe transcendign beyond all mental limitations and concepts into pure potentiality :D I like all philosophies of science, physics and overall approaches to epistemology and reality. :D

Possibly all those different approaches can be grounded in cognitive scientific frame of neurophenomenological classifiers assigning truth (probabilistic certainity) to statements and relationships (infomorphisms) between them?

==Neural Annealing in practice==

You can energize (reinforce) mental objects by directing attentional arrow to it, by it being aligned with valence gradient (aethetics, resolving basic needs), sensory data (what aligns with "reality" or imagined expectations is reinforced), surprise (prediction error adds entropic activity to fix prediction errors to tune models by finding policies to edit internal models or act on the world), you can also modify (transform) it into a more consonant symmetrical shape, you can energize it so much that its dissolves by overwhelming, you can weaken attentional resources (forces) by globalizing them (attention to background stillness, vastness, silentness, boundarylessness, centerlessness, infinityness,...) resulting in global smoothening as local topological shapes in the neural tissue through global acticity gets more coarsegrained, more smoothened, more redistributed, and you can also avoid mental objects.

Love or seeing constructedness (illusorynessness) of mental phenomena seems to be an universal dissolver of any mental object or conditioned reactive patterns of behavior canalizations. Or explicit relaxation of any contracted qualia.

Canalized Mr Meeseeks protective subagents - dissolve by showing them counterfactual proof that they dont need to be so defensive in a new environment and that they can relax.

Dissolving held psychotic (misaligned with other processes or destructive rather than helping) beliefs with showing them opposite evidence, relativizing them away.

Avoiding overly protective subagents by not getting into hostile environments or consume limbic hijacking fear inducing memeplexes on social media or news. Satisfy the objective functions and create compromises in your whole ecosystem of subagents having different priotiries, don't isolate any as then he tends to canalize protective structures hostile against others.

Depressive beliefs such as "Everyone always leaves", "People look at me like they hate me", "I am afraid I will say something stupid" are also dissolvable with counterfactual evidence. One can create a dialog between the hurt subagent and a "healer" subagent, asking about what it is, what its priorities are, how it was formed, what other beliefs or subagents it depends on

Some linguistic or abstract mental construction is seen as true if many observes agree on its validity using different epistemological strategies, beliefs present in a population can be disrupted or reinforced or novel ones created by mutating or creating a new belief that is compatible with the culture's current aethetics (superstructure framing priors that are preffered according to their consonance with the whole) and spreading it succesfully darwinianly.

Any neural operator (psychotool or a substance) that symmetrifies neurophenomenology tends to also increase energy, probably because of disintegration of energy sinks so unsinked energy flows randomly with much less attracting forces, which might lead to seeing visuals as well. 

Energy sink can act as a neural classifier taking sensory data as input and outputing other thoughts or actions. Low energy depression seems to be damping energy through no learned agency. (hopelessness isnt learned, its that no agency is learned [Helplessness Is Not Learned - Neurofrontiers]([Helplessness Is Not Learned - Neurofrontiers]([Helplessness Is Not Learned - Neurofrontiers](https://neurofrontiers.blog/helplessness-is-not-learned/))) ) Which might be seen as no sensory patters cascading into possible actions, no dopaminogentic motivation. Symmetrical representations can create global cascade of activation of neural representations from just one through more interconnected neural topology (meditation and psychedelics increase that). We can damp energy by getting into gettign stuck into some one solid mental object. One can collapse from deconstructed entropic state back into some highly specialized context to concetrate all that free computational power into one task and use it all there, its asymmetry (high overfitted specialization) can damp overall energy. 

Any mental and physical activity that increases energy follows period of decreased energy, so thats a way to overall dampen energy as well. The stronger the increase, the stronger the decrease tends to be. Gradual increasing can be achieved by slow gradual increase such that neural networks adapt to a new baseline, just like progressive overload in fitness.

When it comes to shifting energy from one task to another one, one can in the global context see reason for doing that to generate motivation. We climb valence gradients realized as error reduction slopes of solving the problem better than expected, so depending on our aethtics and current problems we solve in life, we can shift our attention by lubricating those fundamental objective functions in our deepest bayesian priors, which also increases wellbeing through increased sense of meaning and motivation and reduces procrasination. 

More trust, more bayesian prior, aethetics, goal synchronization, leads to more efficient belief transmission, more efficient updating of maladaptive priors. Ideal psychotherapheutic setting definitely depends on the cultural aethetics of the client - some people are raised religious, some secular, some think more in mechanistic terms, some think more in fantasy narratives and so on. 

Songs are definitely also subjective to high degree as they active consonant memories through context dependant associations leading to good transformative trips. 

Songs with long global consonant tones are great for global information processing. Extremely fast songs are good at local information processing. Some songs have both in parallel which is great for combined information processing.

Can this scalefree metamodel be used as a fundamental ontology to encapsulate all scientific fields, where every thing is some kind of special case on some scale on some level of abstraction with some kind of implementation? 

Are organisms nested holographic quantum reference frames, attractor in nonequilibrium thermodynamics constructing goals that form higher order goals across scales?

Instead of asking "Is this inherently good or bad?" ask "What advantages and disadvantages does this have? (in relation to making the world a better place?)"

There are so many concrete or more general equations and models used in different natural fields and subfields in different scales with different advantages and disadvantages, predictive and explanatory power and paradoxes in different contexts. Can we put them all in this metaframework to find potential for compatibility and incompatibility analysis, create merging and synthesis on a higher order of complexity, and gather the sum of total human scientific knowledge on one place in this structured manner? 

Theory of every thing, At start, there is just an empty canvas full of infinite potential 

On this empty canvas, you can put any set of fundamental philosophical assumptions 

Those philosophical assumptions are initial structures that constrain what structures are classified as true and false 

As I'm writing this, this is already initializing many philosophical assumptions, like total openmindedness fundamentalism, truth relativism and propositional information structure ontology and so on, but we have to start somewhere 

To create futher constrain on the space of possible structures, I'm gonna assume that each structure in this metamodel can live (as has many implementations realtime) as a structure inside potential system inside physicalism with quantum information processing ontology

Using (quantum) free energy principle as abstraction that works tautologically for making sense of any structure, a minimal unifying model across fields, scales, contexts and so on

Any philosophical, ontological, pragmatic and so on assumption that an Active Inference agent can assert is a concrete phenotype, an evolutionary niche emerging from the evolutionary interactions of the agent's genetics (initial source code) and environment (inputs to source code's development)

Any thing, process, pattern a sensemaking agent or collective of agents can locate in its constructed spacetime is a statistical correlation between its internal and external states to reduce its uncertainity about the world to initialize uncertainity reducing internal metacognitive model and policies updates and external actions

Most predictive structures are hieachical probabilistic bayesian multiscale metagraphs with links corresponding to predicted causality

In biological agents, this uncertainity imperative can be futher granualized into maslow hiearchy of needs, reformulated as a interconnected nodes corresponding to different homeostatic subagents with goals that through collective behavior form higher order goals across scales about individual or collective uncertainity reduction 

They correspond to nested holographic quantum reference frames, attractors in quantum nonequilibrium thermodynamics

Each statistical (dynamical) markov blanket corresponding to a thing has its own implementational level, such as animal, neuron, functional brain region, molecule, fundamental particle and so on

Various models or (differential) equations in various fields studying physical systems study some local very concretely implemented subset of all those global general dynamics, they're some evolutionary learned bayesian phenotype, some attractor, some markov blanket, some thing stable in (usefully constructed) space and time, or beyond spacetime in various fundamental models in physics 

Quantum free energy principle tells us that for other systems for communication measurable physical classical information lives on a markov blanket boundary of a system and correponds to the internal system's dynamics, taken from the holographic principle in physics

Lets create a hypergraph of all natural and nonnatural disciplines? 

Any agent's model can be understood in terms of FEP as uncertainity reducing structured learned correlations in a bayesian graph serving as approximations of its external dynamics

Making FEP a framework that can already can encompass every thing 

[Branches of science - Wikipedia]([Branches of science - Wikipedia]([Branches of science - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_science)))

[Outline of academic disciplines - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_academic_disciplines)

This way, all science agents emerge from FEP as evolutionary niches through (collective) cognitive science

generalized into any kind of symbolic and nonsymbolic mental frameworks 

In this frame, constructing a physical theory of everything looks at what niches of uncertainity are various fields reducing and attempts to synthetize them by finding correspondences between the mathematical structures

Its fitting curves in data all way down [Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/machine-scientists-distill-the-laws-of-physics-from-raw-data-20220510/)) 

If one goes fully general, without introducing FEP assumptions, one can assume that the whole universe is an one structure and each field is sculping certain substructure with more global or local models and laws

Adding global constrains to this structure sculps parts of it

(aka model/reduce uncertainity about it)

Such as "only predictive models", "only mathematical models", "only quantum models", "only classical models in spacetime", "only models in physicalist ontology", "models correspond to some local realist objective structure", "models are just nonlocal relational parts of mental interface", "only models in complex adaptive systems frame", "taking in account existence of scales and emergence", "taking in account levels of analysis (are they just different parts of the system/abstractions?)" 

One cn expand the whole universe assumption to any words in general to include everything philosophy

At the same time, philosophy can be understood as uncertainity reducing structures in cognitive science

Interdisciplinary Studies: Complex adaptive systems Environmental Studies Global Studies Biotechnology Data Science

I wonder if global graph of knowledge could be automatized by:

fusing all lists of fields on the internet or science journals

taking all text on the internet that comes up when searching for the field name

analyzing the statistical text/theme overlap to quantify relatedness

finding interdisciplionary fields by seeing how two concrete fields' text fuse together statistically?

finding labels for sets of fields by dimensionality reduction algorithms?

Let's construct science fields bottom up inside complex physical systems with various scales frame

Each single pattern, process, thing (having a markov blanket) is totally unique on its own and study of it can be its own totally concrete scientific field 

by futher abstraction we get fields that study various phenotypes

Reductive fundamental physics studies everything existing at the smallest possible scale 

By looking into emergence of patterns from one scale to another such as emergence of spacetime or biology from fundamental particle physics, we interconnect various scales and thus basically create more interdisciplionarity

Complex adaptive systems is extremely interdisciplionary, but still starts with certain assumptions

The only field that is totally global across all fields is technically a blank canvas, nothing, no information, because any information assumes constrains

Abstraction is great for putting high level less context/scale dependant patterns into language and maths 

Depending on what level of abstraction one does engineering, one operates with a field that is that level of abstraction

Blank canvas includes all languages

Each language can contain many concrete structures, philosophical, scientific, laymen etc. 

Language can also be seen as just informtion theoretic communication protocol between agents for model exchange 

Free energy principle just seems as the most pragmatic metalanguage

All human knowledge framed inside the free energy principle

Free energy principle is general ontology and language for information processing in physics and individual and collective sensemaking

==Agency==

Great talk about how limited metacognitive agency over thought and preferences is implemented in the mind [Conversation between Mark Solms, Chris Fields, and Mike Levin 2 - YouTube]([Conversation between Mark Solms, Chris Fields, and Mike Levin 2 - YouTube]([Conversation between Mark Solms, Chris Fields, and Mike Levin 2 - YouTube](https://youtu.be/1S4jaYjuzm0)))

aka the ability to decide what your next thought and preferences will be is limited by our phenotype (the set of observable characteristics or traits of an organism (in this case of our mind)) emerging from genetic and environmental influences

Technically Big five model of personality or Jung's archetypes are describing phenotypes

By being raised in specific culture also determines a phenotype in thinking and behavior

In dynamical systems language its an attractor

There also seem to be various neural correlates that determine the strength of forms of agency, such as disconnection of certain brain regions in unconctollable destructive addictive behavior.

Someone should invest heavily in brain computer interfaces enhancing the control over ourselves by strenghtening those neural networks üòÉ

I find this as fascinating start when it comes to decoding thoughts [Semantic reconstruction of continuous language from non-invasive brain recordings | bioRxiv]([Semantic reconstruction of continuous language from non-invasive brain recordings | bioRxiv]([Semantic reconstruction of continuous language from non-invasive brain recordings | bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.29.509744v1)))

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811923004068 (Disentangling the neural correlates of agency, ownership and multisensory processing)

Hmm here they locate what goes wrong in decreased sense of agency [Neural correlates of sense of agency in motor control: A neuroimaging meta-analysis - PubMed]([Neural correlates of sense of agency in motor control: A neuroimaging meta-analysis - PubMed]([Neural correlates of sense of agency in motor control: A neuroimaging meta-analysis - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32502189/)))

I would argue the development of the networks implementing healthy sense of agency needs to be fundamentally supported by training them like muscles (genetics also play a role) so there's evolutionary pressures for them to be developed. This seems to be the fuction of certain meditation practices, going out of comfort zone practices, systematic dedication to one bigger task skill, stabilizing routine skill, or delayed gratification practices ü§î

Its also interesting how stimulants or lower doses of psychedelics tend to increase agency

==Compassion==

Compassion is fundamental mental muscle to cultivating strong human relationships that are number one predictor of individual and collective wellbeing. We need more culture of compassion in our culture. 

We take so many to us deeply important human connections for granted and when they start dissapearing we start to see their true worth.

Be grateful, compassionate, connect, love.

It fascinates me how people on the death bed tend to care much less about how much money and work they did, but that they should have strenghtened the human connections with those they love the most that might be gone already leading to strong griefing.

I love one lens on psychotheraphy, that lots of psychotherapeuts see their clients mechanistically and try to look for a mechanistic problem that needs to be solved according to predefined symbolic trees/ methodologies. This definitely has its use and should be used a lot, but fusing rationality with intuition is IMO ideal. But I would argue that to fully understand the lens of the other beings that might be deeply suffering, one should try to synchronize with them as much as possible mentally. Get as much as possible into their world by listening as deeply as possible, synchronizing breathing itself can increase sense of connection. [Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony]([Frontiers | Therapeutic Alliance as Active Inference: The Role of Therapeutic Touch and Synchrony](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.783694/full))))))) Being in the present moment with the other as deeply as possible, almost fusing together mentally and this way finding solutions by using the deepest intuition. Something like tends to be practiced in Gestalt psychotherapheutic method for example. The deep compassion definitely has its advantages and disadvantages, as feeling the suffering of others so directly can really overwhelm one's mental state if not enough healing to get back into less suffering states is done.

I love one lens on psychotheraphy, that lots of psychotherapeuts see their clients mechanistically and try to look for a mechanistic problem that needs to be solved according to predefined symbolic trees/ methodologies. This definitely has its use and should be used a lot, but fusing rationality with intuition is IMO ideal. But I would argue that to fully understand the lens of the other beings that might be deeply suffering, one should try to synchronize with them as much as possible mentally. Get as much as possible into their world by listening as deeply as possible, synchronizing breathing itself can increase sense of connection.

Something like tends to be practiced in Gestalt psychotherapheutic method for example. The deep compassion definitely has its advantages and disadvantages, as feeling the suffering of others so directly can really overwhelm one's mental state if not enough healing to get back into less suffering states is done.

==Statespace of mind's complexity==

In the valence (free energy) landscape, in a way some negative valence petrubations helps the system find more better overall positive valence local minimas 

In less technical terms, suffering has the ability to force you to fix suboptimal internal and external conditions

Error signals motivating you to get into a better st√°tƒõ/configuration

Always transform hopelessness to hope even in the darkest times

Or remind oneself that consciousness/universe/third more complex or simple thing underlying everything just is timelessly spacelessly no matter what contents it has inside it

I love absolute deconstructing on meditation to neither being nor nonbeing and then reconstructing with more love and hope

https://twitter.com/Malcolm_Ocean/status/1682032109576396801

After so many deaths where nothing is really fundamental or permanent, one can locate some semipermanent mathematical patterns governing the physicalist evolution of experience

How transferrable among subjects are they? I often wonder

I would suspect the closer they are to mathematical neurophenomenological models, the more universal they tend to be for people that are often inhabiting somewhat deconstructed state

Or state that was never really constructed by pretrained evolution's softwares like the social simulations we tend to construct

The stronger the fuzzy statistical or implementational isomorphism is between two conscious agents' neurophenomenological states, the more likely they will synchronized and feel mutual human relationship interconnectedness

Some say strong human relationships is more fundamental basic need than physiological needs in Maslow hiearchy of needs

We went from social coherence having pretty stable nonequlibrium steady states in villages stabilized by local culture and rituals to internet age that is constantly penetrating any attempts at stable cultural attractors by constant information overload from everywhere, leading to inability of individuals to synchronize in this extremely technilogically interconnected and also culturally polarized world

From (pre)modernism to postmodernism

Though i love the attempts at creating stable cultural frameworks by the synthesis of all good from all concrete frameworks into a metaframework (metamodern approaches)

Psychedelics and deconstructive meditation helps a ton to get out of concrete local minima, which can lead to belief network's constant unstability, which can generate both random concrete processes battling with eachother dissonanly not unified by their intrinsic similarity or some top down cybernetic controller leading to unpleasant mental chaos, or it can lead to empty mind full of freedom and nonsymbolic free symmetrical consonant flow of isness that buddhism and taoism loves

Another attempt is taking the great amount of conflicting processes from various cultural frameworks and try to stabilize them by creating s metaframework in metamodern synthetizing integrative ways, unify rational and spiritual enlightenement, unify various scientific schools of thought with unifying various spiritual schools of thought, or creating a metatheory on top of them, creating this global stabilization of concrete belief networks' topologies interconnected by general correlations 

See it all using the free energy principle fully general mathematical framework for formalizing any information processing system? 

==Relax==

The fact that most of the time we inhabit some somewhat stable reality with somewhat stable laws is mindboggling, but without stability of our inner world simulation there wouldnt be shared language and it's harder to survive, but too much predicted stability leads to crises

Having days to have deepest rest in structurelessness by deconstructive meditation Jhana hybernation annealing psychotechnology is important for recharging and cleaning the mind, leading to more symmetrical sense of wellbeing and freedom.

Take days meditating in silence between productive days

To connect and feel emotions

Not repress them but use them as a drive, feel whole

It helps with many psychological blocks 

Our society is built around emotion denial so much and then we tend to not feel meaning

==Enlightenment==

Matrix is real world

Illusion is truth

Mundane is divine

Duality is nonduality

Form is emptiness 

Maya is Brahman

Phenomena are noumena

All is thing in itself

Is complex PTSD that shatters your stable structures in the brain followed by inner meditative work such as loving doing nothing one possible path to enlightenment?

If you want stream entry another option is to induce a complex PTSD (that can be gathered overtime by experiencing tons of terrible shattering traumatic stuff) which results in your brain in splitting in two and get dissociation like this, which can feel like becoming giant third eye general overseeing octopus god (the second stage visual is perfectly fitting it) but then you have to clean all the related traumas from memories or overall dissonance but thats the form of dark night in that case - i think this was more of my case and meditation plus psychedelics was form of healing the dark night through even more deconstruction and transformation of traumatic structures using love and enptiness which still sometimes shows up when some unhealed parts come up from subconscious when doing dissolving internal unification for example and I work with it.

I feel like phase shift of the organism's structure has to happen always by some kind of shock, let it be dissolution via (loving) doing nothing where your usual stable structures dissolve/transform from not enough stressing support or dissolution via intense shocking experience that shatters your usual stable structures and explodes them to infinity, in both cases you're more free from darwinian restrictions as your before you's evolutionary pretrained social etc. structures die and you get expansive general neural networks to construct your structures in. It seems to me without an intense evolutionary pressure for the system to shift into a different equilibrium state there will be not as much progress really made, you can hear Frank Yang tal kabout how he felt like literally (also physically) dying x times, I felt that too many times. By experiencing what you dont want the most also tends to expand the space of things in which you're not feeling resistance to the experience.

As a result you get dark night where the organism's before software evaluating what is meaningful gets shattered or you get total permanent ego (concrete self model) dissolution/death full of disconnections or some other kind of traumatic structures from which organism dissociated from, or instead you get kundalini awakening ejaculating into the universe kind of stuff for some time as a result of releasing tons of repressed emotions/concepts/wants/goals/need for freedom from "cage" of your before stable structures that you didnt like and tried to escape from them happens.

I often wonder how many meditators by default live in very unpleasant state and thats why they wanna dissociate from it and many succeed and overall result in even higher wellbeing (Shinzen Young having troubles with brownies, Frank Yang having manic BPD, all was shattered into noself tranquil flow state) when compared to normies that live in semipleasant state all the time feeling connected to the collective (via having community friend group with culture or accepting system's ideology/philosophy without constant desynchronization) without all the trauma or intense experiences (tho one can still argue about their baseline state, and also there is enormous diversity, i mean normies that report high degree of wellbeing being functioning in our social simulations) which may all be to first approximation reducible to the symmetry theory of valence applied to implementational harmonics/neural field theory or applied to bayesian belief network topology (with self, identities, others, environment, universe, assumptions, abstract concepts, everything else and their interconnectedness lives), where it would be constructed isolated rigid overfitted person having it worse than happy normies having it worse than really desontructed expansive noself state in permanent nondual flow where you get general playground for anything including easily entereing Jhanic structureless void beyond evolutionary pretrained software with efficient stress dissipation and metacognition over how your brain generates your thoughts, adaptive identities, emotions and overall models and experience, but here there might be a disadvantage of needed more metabolic/conscious energy to create local concrete nongeneral structures, and even there there might be giant diversity of baseline happiness depending on what kind of dissonance/asymmetry/disconnection generators structures might still be lurking in the conscious or subconscious. Or one form of dissociation can give you the ability to create governing structure turning off and on the various suffering generators.

==Towards a unified theory of consciousness with understanding happiness on all levels of analysis==

==Void, the unknown==

When we disintegrate to the void, we see the deepest knowns in the unknown, we see in it the deepest most fundamental bayesian priors that construct our existence, our personality, our life narrative, our reality, such as birth, our initial interactions with the environment, our initial experiences with others, initial cultural, philosophical, spiritual, religious, ideological mental frameworks, initial paradigms of thought, ontologies, the best experiences of cosmic unity, psychological death, trauma, because unknowness is pure stochastic flow of information in the nervous system that doesn't get caught by any local classifiers so it gets caught by the widest deepest metapatterns stored in the nervous system that we then project onto the fundamental mysterious unknowness in us or the world or both or something third, that we project onto reality, onto existence. We can fear the unknown, see it in death, we can hate it, we can love it, see it in pure loving awareness, we can be neutral towards it. Those deepest bayesian priors are dynamical and be strenghtened, weakened aka fluidified, or altered aka transformed.

Disacceleration Accelerationism!

Symmetry is a general term for less structure, less information, less difference, less dualities, less complexity, more similarity, easier flow 
similarity or exact correspondence between different things. Doesn't change (is invariant) under change of conditions (under transformation).

Sufferlessness is structurelessness.

Relaxxing maxxing.

Dropping, transcending everything, personality, intentions, doing, meditating, watching, awareness, dualities, void, being, dissolve all concepts, grounds, struture, transcending transcendence itself.

For example "everything is made of awareness" is a global symmetry in mental representations.

===Mathematical grasp===

Let spacestate of consciousness (neurophenomenology) be a latent space corresponding to a space of possible configurations of a hypergraph of causal bayesian beliefs with nodes corresponding to hiearchical Markov blankets that represent enabled functional correlations of the internal states with the external states of the organism edges corresponding to communication or causality or reinforcement from belief A to belief B where each Markov blanket can be seen as soliton in a field of consciousness, stable regularity across spacetime.

Let Markov blanket on functional level correspond to soliton in electromagnetic chemical implementational level, coupled oscillators. Markov blanket is any given qualia. Getting reinforced by its surrounding qualia, being bound in one space.

Let negatively valenced Markov blankets be parts with spiky shape more easily causing dissonance and harder harmony and sense of interconnectedness (resulting in sense of meaning) with the collective thanks to more asymmetries in geometrical belief structure, creating more density, less information flow, in dynamics.

Let psychotic subagents be a markov blanket with different goals than the collective.

Let hurt subagent be a markov blanket with belief structure such that there has been failure in achieving a goal or loss of important dependent surrounding Markov blanket for Its goals (usually some basic needs are not met, can relate to dissonance in social graph).

Let the most felt meaningful statespace of consciousness be dissolution of all individual Markov blankets resulting in one single unified top down process encoding the felt source of all there is the most directly.

Let groundless ground be a metastable in time state with unconditional lubricating symmetrifying top down Markov blanket being stable by bayesian reinforcement from sense of unity constantly giving sense of freedom to all local Markov blankets (dereifying, emptiness) giving it sense of it being a process.

Meditation is about asymmetry, spikiness, disconectedness, nonvalence (resisting) reduction.

Let do nothing, let go of grasping, be a psychotechnology corresponding to a neural operator that globally reduces suffering by reducing asymmetries in all local Markov blanket soliton mental representations leading to less dissonant interaction with the rest.

Let love and kindness be a a special case of that in the social graph, leading to feeling more positive valence, interconnected with others. Fabric softener of reality. Equaminity too with reducing stress by increasing stress dissipation ability of the network. Both are asymmetry reduction techniques.

It can be generalized to cultivating love for all that is, leading to higher valence and consonance between the self model, models of others and of the global model in which all local models are hieachically embedded.

Every mind oscillates between attractors from a set of attracting states with metastable causal bayesian hypergraph.

Everything that is is just cluster of stable soliton bayesian Markov blanket beliefs that are reinforced by themselves or by other mental constructions or patterns in sensory data, regularities in phenomenal and physical spacetime.

Let meaning of all be a mental representation with highest valence, a topdown process attractor attracting and generating everything else, giving raise to and sense of reason behind all behavior and giving sense valuableness to different activities and mental representations, a force giving sense of direction in life, motivational field, feeder of energy and nurishment to everything else.

Goals as counterfactual simulations that result in higher local or global valence of internal representations.

"Evil" tag of mental representations emerging from desire to be happy under dissonant conditions and labeling that thing as direct causal mode generating dissonance in both phenomenology and physical world.

Internal Family Systems is psychotechnology activating and healing, aligning hurt subagents. 

Mindfulness is giving valence->meaning to raw sensory data.

Statistical hulls keep things stable. Going to the Felt "core" penetrates this statistical hull.

A lot of theraphy is based on using empathy as ways to open that coping statistical hull and dissolve/transform that dissonant belief, such as internal family systems, and selfimprovement Is about implementing stable positive ones that are selfreinforcing enough by external evidence or evidence from other mental representations, such as healthy lifestyle frameworks.

Deconstrtive meditation is also a lot about dissolving the statistical hulls of clusters of bayesian beliefs that can be analyzed as particle waves.

Spaciousness meditation redistributes weights given to bayesian beliefs more globally by noticing thinness and openness of body and all sensations, less local focus.

Transcending darwinian programs such as need for social status and reinforced concrete identity or conditioned happiness realized as attachment to material objects or too much of sexual urges is useful for this weight globalization leading to destressification, dissolving preinstalled affective matrix.

That can be weakened by giving it less weight but not denying it, that will give it more weight as that's the opposite of equaminity.

Equaminity as ability to let things be in the background without interference, without friction.

Concetration as the ability to keep concetrated on a concetration object and noticing that one got caught up in a tangles cluster of sensations and clarity as the ability to untagle this knot and free it by expanding it to spaciousness. Aka delocaliting weights, increasing stress dissipation of the field of consciousness.

A possibility that the Markov blanket soliton belief in phenomenology might be statistically functional property of the neural dynamics but can be implemented as distributed activity? There also may be bayesian beliefs in neuronal dynamics not reflected in phenomenology as its conditional probability distributions, and vice versa.

Is nonalive physics fundamental? Or consciousness? Or combination of those? Or something third? Or all of them?

====Happiness, wellbeing====

=====Technical=====

'''Synthesis'''

Equaminity as a cultivatable skill of learning to not interfere with what is by acceptance seems to be a special case of symmetrification and symmetrifications in general seem to cultivate wellbeing if they make long lasting symmetrifying changes. Some symmetrifications such as fast sugar come at the cost of possible overall desymmetrification when taken in a bigger picture using neurobiology and what it affects in time, considering its consequences. Other symmetrifications that actually cultivate stable kinds of symmetrifications may be love and kindness, any kinds of dissolutions (sense of truths, center, space, time, direction - stage theory of enlightenment), finding some concrete direction, simplified good enough for nonscientific purpose model of the world, or some kind of concrete meaning in life. (tho here i think the best kind of symmetrification is to not have any kind of symbolic meaning as not clinging to concrete mental constructions and constructing conditioned happiness seem to an even bigger symmetrification) Psychedelics can also dissolve the rigid self model but the organism as a defence mechanism might create even more rigid giant self model that generates even more suffering through its density, but also not.

My most efficient annealing techniques that I combine with eachother. Each of them raise the energy parameter of experience and tend to dissolve local dualistic structures in favor of more global interconnected structure that manifest as high level connections insights and overall sense of less blocked experience, and also satisfies other kinds of basic needs:

Loving do nothing deconstructive meditation

Walking and running in nature

Reading/Listening to big picture thinking

Hot shower/bath

Talking about the depths of my mind with myself or with others or by writing

Deep slow meditative mindful tantric interaction with other people

Psychedelics, shrooms, LSD or 5-MeO-DMT - Shrooms is more dissolving but still full of interesting loving complexity, LSD focuses on concrete task more such as learning, 5-MeO-DMT just dissolves everything beyond concepts and tasks

'''Approaches'''

We feel happy when we are in a flow state. Flexible adaptable communication between networks.<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6123521/ Brain networks of happiness: dynamic functional connectivity among the default, cognitive and salience networks relates to subjective well-being, Liang Shi et al., 2018]</ref> Between parts. Consonance. Alignment. Symmetry. Flow. Suffering is felt when there is tons of asymmetries in brain dynamics.<ref>[[The Symmetry Theory of Valence 2020 Overview]([The Symmetry Theory of Valence 2020 Overview]([Qualia Research Institute](https://qri.org/)blog/symmetry-theory-of-valence-2020)) Symmetry Theory of Valence, Andr√©s G√≥mez-Emilsson, 2020]</ref>

Short term local surface pleasure seems to be insatisfactory and therefore addictive.

Long term global deep pleasure seem to be satisfactory and full of meaning with lasting effects and therefore not addictive. (post jhana/psychedelic unity and clarity) 

Junk food is the first case.

Jhanas are the second case. (it goes even beyond long termness or depthness as time and space gets deconstructed)

Fast euphoria is high frequency metronome consonance, in stimulants or joyful concetration meditation, excitement, convergent attention, possibly dopamine, possibly first Jhanas, can be followed by slow dyphoria or not

Slow euphoria is slow frequency consonance in opioids or relaxing meditation, possibly second jhana, can be followed by fast dyphoria or not

Spiritual/philosophical/selforganized criticality euphoria is fractal consonance/dissonance, crosscale coupling, high frequency temporal or spacily things couple with slow frequency ones (psychedelics, meeting god, oneness, being aligned with meaning), possibly higher Jhanas territory, can have globally distributed paralel attention points<ref>[[Wireheading Done Right: Stay Positive Without Going Insane | Qualia  Computing]([Wireheading Done Right: Stay Positive Without Going Insane | Qualia  Computing]([Wireheading Done Right: Stay Positive Without Going Insane | Qualia  Computing](https://qualiacomputing.com/2016/08/20/wireheading_done_right/))) Wireheading Done Right: Stay Positive Without Going Insane, Andr√©s G√≥mez-Emilsson, 2016]</ref>

End level jhanas and 5-MeO-DMT generates perfect alignment, continuous symmetry across scales and space in neuronal dynamics, it's the hedonium molecule.

Psychedelics multiply the amount of consciousness, dissociatives remove it.

Positive psychological valence can be seen attraction towards that experience, how at home we feel when experiencing the experience. How it makes sense in the higher context. how fullfilled our desires are. Source of internal peace. Symmetrical dynamics.

Overall sense of wellbeing - not a chemical but the stable configuration/topology of the neural networks, its resonant modes, its resting state default amount of consonance and symmetry - your default mode of information processing.

There are happiness genes. 

Strong meaningful relationships with other humans and collective activity towards better world give happiness. Basic needs in general.

Before and after: learning to relax, turning off all software, destabilizing destructive patterns in thought and behavior, learning to getting unstuck from maladaptive mind states, learning to direct my hyperfocus energy productively to do what I care about, creating meaningful human connections connected to behaviors where I feel flourishing in, cultivating purpose to help everyone but taking it lightly as fun play and not forgetting selfcare in relation to rest, basic needs, selfactualization etc. too but also help others with all of this,...

====Self, ego====

=====Laymen=====

The ego, the self, identity is usually considered as the thing we answer when someone asks us: "Who are you?" "What are you?" "What do you do?" "What is your personality?" "What are your traits?" 

=====Technical=====

Ego can in general be seen as through time metastable hieachical predictive structure, some cluster of linguistic or abstract bayesian beliefs with the predicted property of not being dissolvable in any circumstances, sometimes excluding death. Emergent property of nonlinear interacting parts. I predict myself therefore I am.

Local ego is structure embedded inside global ego, where global ego is the whole field of awareness and local ego the animal self's narrative, I predict being therefore there is existence.

Some people call the local ego soul, they predict its eternal. Some people call the globl ego god consciousness. It can be predicted as infinite awareness beyond physical realm. Part of "self", "outside world", "beyond both" is an arbitrary tag we put to qualia. It can be seen as structures in the self, world, and outside of those (abstract space) models in our generative model embedded in our cortical hiearchy.

====Flow state====

Symmetrical consonant smooth cooperative neurophenomenology. 

====Values====

Values correspond to processes<ref>[[- YouTube]([- YouTube]([- YouTube]([- YouTube]([- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==hZpKdfbrd6o))))) Rebuilding Society on Meaning's data science research mapping out the statespace of human values, Joe Edelman, 2022]</ref> , interaction of the nervous system with the environment or other nervous systems where nervous system flourishes - is in a flow state, an evolutionary structural niche predisposed by genetics and learned on its own or culturally, clusters of genes increase a probability that the nervous system will learn to flourish in certain set of processes.

====Love====

=====Laymen=====

Love is the existencial stance with reality, way of commiting yourself to a partiular connection in the outer or inner world, or to any thought, concept, process in general.<ref>[[The Last Campfire: Highlights (our final film!) - YouTube]([The Last Campfire: Highlights (our final film!) - YouTube]([The Last Campfire: Highlights (our final film!) - YouTube](https://youtu.be/X_7U1ApSzaM?t==6087))) Daniel Schmachtenberger and John Veraveke discussing the meaning and meta crisis and John Veraveke giving definition of love, 2022]</ref> Love is a trainable skill through love and kindness meditation for example!

3 types of love: very instinctive animal activities like body connection through cuddling, then feeling of belonging in one's social environment through deep meaningful human social connections, and a transcendental unconditional love for all beyond every concepts that the mind can dream up but also includes them all

<references/> 

=====Technical=====

To any mental model in general, emerging from clarity of perception, symmetrical communication between mental models, synchrony of neural populations, when we "love" a mental model, our self model starts to form connections with it, giving rise to higher valence, more symmetrical dynamics in relation to it, so if we love the world, the self model interconnects with the world model and we feel oneness as those models synchronize together in harmony.<ref>[[Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net]([Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net]([Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net]([Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net]([Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net]([Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net]([Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net](https://opentheory.net/2019/11/neural-annealing-toward-a-neural-theory-of-everything/))))))) The Neuroscience of Meditation: Four Models, Love, Michael Edward Johnson, 2018]</ref> I will create a neurosurgery clinic that will be uninstalling loneliness by neurosurgerally interconnecting your self model neural populations with your social graph neural populations by a mental model/generator/stimulator/pump/machine/implant in the brain constantly shooting heroic dose of neverending love and kindness.

<references/>

====Meaning====

=====Laymen=====

Meaning is the sense of interconnectedness with us, others and the world and overall everything.

=====Technical=====

Meaning and love of x as the degree of connectedness with it and the self model, if self model is deconstructed then between it and anything else that is metastable

We see meaning in what we learn to love. We can get stuck and love just a narrow set of mental representations or activities which can turn into addiction, it might be the only thing that brings us positive valence.<ref>[[- YouTube]([- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==6Icb4hu0_OE)) The Tyranny of the Intentional Object: Universal Addictions, Meaning Abuse, and Denied Self-Insights, Andr√©s G√≥mez Emilsson, 2021]</ref> That halts the ability to love and see meaning and enjoyment in every single moment in life.

<references/> 

====Generalized meaning of life====

We are attempting to find what is in us out there. We are selfactualizing, selfevidencing. Trying to align what we predict as perfect homeostatic conditions about us and the world with what we measure by changing environment through changing our inner models or by changing our environment thorugh actions. Trying reduce uncertainity about our conditions for hardwired basic needs and culturally learned objective functions, of our hiearchical graph of subagents. Trying to create synchrony between the self model and world model. Reducing uncertainity/dissonance -> increasing relaxation, destressification -> symmetrification. Flow state might be seen as stress source that is unstressing everything else in experience, even that stress can be dissolved on meditation and psychedelics. Good predictor and regulator of a system must be a model of that system. 

====Agency====

We feel like we have agency when parts of the self model's processes that we identify with are experiencing a flowstate, causal self top down processes predicting what happens by their influence is same as what is measured, dopamine and noradrenaline seem to induce those.

====Emotions====

Emotions or ontologies, bayesian priors in general, are like Global Giant Waves, Giant forces, when it comes to thought and behavior selection, probably imolemented as global information processing by global synchronization of neural populations

====Nofap?====
I prefer rarefap/raresex as alternative for it not loosing magic.
Doing it rarely to supercharge sexual experience though enhanced intensity, drive, spirituality, love, magic, thirst for life, creativity and so on, minimizing disadvanategs and maximizing advantages, and less in high doses narrowing addiction means more sense of global meaning which used to be a problem to me, not bombarding the reward circuitry, letting it recharge, but not totally abstaining from it.
Timing (potent or hyperpotent) reward sensory stimuli (porn, high sugar/fat/E621 food, yummy stuff on social media,...) induced endorphin/endocannaboid/opioid/etc. releases to not build too much tolerance but also not doing anything at all leading to for longer time unused resource of them that doesnt increase in size anymore by more recharging, maximizing total amount of euphoria qualia and overall wellbeing qualia, or similarly with psychedelics
I believe there is optimal threshold where the total sum of euphoria from such rewarding activities is maximized by choosing some perfect intervals between them. (essencially computing integral)  (that is dynamical and individual)
My dynamics are probably unique because of my extreme hypersensitivity to all stimuli. 
There's only finite amount of energy (computational power) and reward circuitry reinforcement loops, tolerance and so on. But those circuits can when used wisely generate very pleasureful or deeply meaningful experiences.
And it can be used to reinforce certain activities by seeing it as a reward after completing some bigger task, or the reward must be not known because then it stops being a big reward, so ideally when the intervals between are random, which generates this kind of motivation to fullfill those tasks. (among many other types of motivations such as nonsexual social connection) Too many rewards without doing any tasks can lead to loss of motivation, agency, drive, meaning and so on. But fapping/sex can also reduce stress, strain, pain, increasing sleep quality, help find oneselfes sexually.
You can also use dopamine as anticipating reward motivation molecule in hornyness (and increasing it via fapping) as a kind of free stimulant.
Also I would argue there's a big difference between just not so meaningfully fapping and a whole process of sexual intercourse with foreplay, deep tantric interconnecting, cuddling, slow sex, (instinct driven) fast sex, postcuddles, sleep, that's very deeply healing interconnecting vulnerability building thing! As much rhythmic entrainment as possible. 
Or you can say that pleasant states of consciousness not related to one's direct transcendental meaning are not worth it and you want all the training resources to be allocated to that higher order meaning, also an option.

====Fear====

Panicking subagents' error signals propagating rhtough the nervous system.

====Conflicts====

Conflicts are the result of (overly) confident mutually asymmetric beliefs creating friction by selfevidencing attempts interaction increasing tension leading to blow up

====Neurodiscomfort and neurodivergences====

A pattern in thinking is a disorder if it disallows the individual to feel happiness and achieve his values and goals in which he sees meaning.

Psychopathologies Are characterized by oscillopathy, by isolation of parts, by beliefs not modelling sensory data accurately, by stuckness in dissonant metastable attractors in nervous system configurations.

=====PTSD, trauma=====

PTSD, repressed trauma is isolated dissonant subagents, cluster of bayesian beliefs, population of neurons, with very strong statistical hull, sending one directional signal of the belief of something being wrong, being hurt, generating anxiety or depression, in the background to the other processes trying to mind their own business, usually easily triggerable but hard to transform their structure, but its possible with overtime counterfactual data.

=====Depression=====

Depression is learned, formed by memories, stable helplessness/hopelesness prior from repeated failures in reducing uncertainity and solving basic needs.<ref>[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763422003621 Oversampled and undersolved: Depressive rumination from an active inference perspective, Max Berg et al., 2022]</ref>

Many priors are interconnected and codependent, so when you transform or dissolve one, many others can follow. Present counterfactuals in vulnerable memory reconsolidation phase where statistical hull is weakened through dialog activation to transform it effectively. Beta blockers increase vulnerability. MDMA adds additional love.

====Psychedelics assisted psychotheraphy====

To heal a person in substance assisted psychotheraphy, you have to install a positive valence belief that is compatible with his existing framework/aethetics that doesn't spiral him into failure modes that is a cluster of bayesian beliefs reinforced by sensory data, or selfreinforced tautologically, or reinforced by other beliefs, through for example belief transforming internal family systems, and to install it you can synchronizace with the person by minimizing friction by embodying his mental framework. My favorite prior is love and gratitude for all that is!

====love and kindness====

Love and kindness is interconnecting smoothening symmetrifying operator between the self model and the social over overall mental representation graph by canalization force.

Learning to love and accept all that is will result in lightening, fluidifying, floatifying, easifying, undensefying, unrigidityfying, smoothening, interconnecting everything without judgement.

====infinite pleasure (Jhanas), infinite consciousness, void, cessations, Nirodha Samapatti, deities, DMT entities, Gods====

====Dark night of the soul====

[[File:EpistemicAgent.jpg|500px|Alt text]]

[[File:Freedom3.jpg|500px|Alt text]]

[[File:Lattice.jpg|500px|Alt text]]

Dark nights of the soul seem the be the result of disintegration of the psyche before it gets unified with more transcendental nonconceptuality, oneness, love and so on. When the self center hub dissolves, but there is no ocean efficient at stress dissipation of sensations to be effortlessly floating in. So you end up with dense ground with some processes instead. With much less flow of neural activity, its like you literally died, being a rigid disconnected void. Being a rigid metal ground with nothing really happening, or some things happening in their own place, but lonely, depressive or anxious, full of error signals. When the density gets dissolved into fluidity and things just weee by themself and effortless joyous activity happens lightly in this depth, you enter the state of free flowing ocean without effort. Neural annealing activities, interconnecting constructive meditation of love, oneness, beauty, wholeness, mandala, kindness to the rescue!

===Notes by others===

==Other concepts in fields of study in simple and technical terms of the general scientific framework==

===psychology (nostalgia, intelligence)===

====Nostalgia====

Nostalgia can be seen as an inverse of trauma, consance adding to past memories where nervous system thought you flourished, so that you start to idealize the memories blindly seeing it as better than it actually was
it might be evolutionary useful in the sense that it makes you more stick to behaviors that benefited you in relation to those that didnt benefit you, but it has its failure modes, you can start being nostalgic about things that actually harmed you. It might be emergent from the fact that the longer untouched memories are in the brain, the less full of information they tend to be as the structure disintegrates to entropy overtime when one doesnt remind himself often of them to strenghten the connections, which results in the phenomenology of "Good old simple times..."

====Intelligence====

===substances (weed, alcohol)===

===meditation, dharma, psychedelia, spirituality (lucid dreaming, are chakras real?)===

====Dreaming and lucid dreaming====

Dreams are stochastic activity in the neural networks and existing energy sinks that evolutionary survive get projected into the experience. In lucid dreams, self model's causal processes are reconnected. They evolutionary serve the purpose of generalizing our mental representations, such that we don't overfit in everday tasks.<ref>[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921000647 The overfitted brain: Dreams evolved to assist generalization, Erik Hoel, 2021]</ref>

====Chakras====

Chakras may be selforganized attractor topological energy sinks in the nervous system where one feels it, or they may be mapping of states of dynamics of brain centers to the body map representation, they may fascilitate efficient recruiting of certain neural populations for certain tasks, cultivating symmetrification of communication.

====Sex====

Sex can be so very therapeutic, I feel like there are two types of very intense sex: becoming a lustful instinctive animal or connecting deeply through relaxation (long foreplay, slow cuddling, a little light, candle, relaxing music, massage... warm shower/bath/hot tub)... in both cases, thinking is muted, one is in the present, there is mutual union with the universe

====message, music====

===selfimprovement (monk mode, avoiding instant gratification, habit building)===

===neurotechnology (merging with machines, enhancing intelligence and feels)===

===unified physics, AGI alignment, philosophical play, other notes===

====Studying====

I study in a way that I find a group or person who's the best in the field and look at his text or lecture summarizing the field and then dig into the details while having context. I myself also maximize learning stuff related to wellbeing from all possible perspectives which isnt everyone's case. This is problem with lots of current schools. Kids report not knowing what the stuff they are learning is for. They miss context. It can be how its used in everyday life, future work, science of progress and wellbeing, sustainibility, unifying people and so on. Making money effectively can also be a goal but taking to the extreme kills collective wellbeing and coordinated existencial risks solving. No wonder they are unmotivated to learn it and interpret it as useless noise. Another factor is that school decouples learning from fun. Fun is a oelasure category our mind constructs to make play bereable and play is used to produce training data. If we look at how we learn in neuroscience, knowledge motly gets stuck in our mind if we evaluate it as relevant in our context for our goals that can be reduced to basic needs, we build a coherent unified model of the world where everything wants to relate to eachother in some way. Valence (internal and external attraction) crisis is killing this. That's why adaptive dynamical systems theory is the most effective metalearning language if one has a goal of maximizing predictive transdisciplinary scientific knowledge. Some people also have more individual or more collective goals. Modern society is too individualistic which connects to the meaning crisis and so on. I would also add training dialog by steelmanning deep goals and values of the motivated wants skill to education more.

====Is there life after death? Is there rebirth?====

Ontologically: Agnostic/fluid between all possibilities/reality goes beyond human concepts (I have that with any question)

Pragmatically in science: Materialistic/Nonpanpsychist/Spacetimefundamentalism/Closed or empty individualism: Probably not empirically provable in our lifetime. Maybe? Nobody actually knows. Idealistic/Panpsychist/Physicalist/Realityisbeyondspacetime/Open individualism: It makes different sense in a a different lens where space and linear time and distinctions are evolutionary useful illusions in the interface with reality.

Pragmatically in experience: Belief in rebirth or eternal life is useful mental construct narrarive to surpress the fear from the unknown of death. I prefer to live in the love with the unknown, that's how I see groundless ground. No conceptual guarding grounding fabrications! Do some death sangha!

====Imagining utopia====

Soon when we solve and transcend loneliness and suffering we will look at our ancestors from our transhumanist neobuddhist AGI global hyperorganism utopia where we are all utterly connected in the void beyond space and time and laugh about how we permanently transcended evolution's tendency to implement "suffering and making distinctions in experience between us in the open individualist field of conscious physics" local minimas while swimming in the blissful moment forever while mitigating destabilizing factors and existencial risks if those arent solved.

[The Symmetry Theory of Valence 2020 Overview]([The Symmetry Theory of Valence 2020 Overview]([Qualia Research Institute](https://qri.org/)blog/symmetry-theory-of-valence-2020)) 

What are your ethics?

Effective buddhahood of internal and external compassion: evaluating beliefs and actions according to calculating an integral of total psychological valence and sustainability of consciousness among time and space

i call my ethics approximate practical utilitariasm such that edge cases and unrealistic scenarios that wouldnt be compatible with the current system that can be mathematically optimal are taken out (plus taking in account the limiting power of the models)

for example if you assume negative utilitarism and some buddhist notions that all concrete life is suffering then the optimal utilitarian move is to get rid of all concrete life to prevent any futher suffering lol

and if suffering is futher generalized by asymmetries in panpsychist framework then the optimal utilitarian move is to theoretically convert the whole universe into zero structure absolutely symmetrical state

more generally if we mathematize psychological valence, it seems that where the line saying this is neutral valence, between positive and negative valence, where its set seems to be arbitrary

if we assume different buddhistic notions (or other framework's notions) where positive valence exists too, then its about maximizing that utility,
though in the panpsychist symmetry formalism its again creating as much symmetries in physics as possible

5-MeO-DMT trips or Jhanas that are meditative states are with almost no structure, with the least amount of symmetry breaking in experience, which seems to be measured in the brain as well to a first approximation, and I also dont know any other states of consciousness that feel as good as those 
assuming the utility we maximize is psychological valence under those formalisms

though pragmatically we need to take in account the whole societal system's all sort of natural laws, game theoretic survivability, ressilience, stability, progression out of bad local minimas and so on

==Multiple people in one brain==

it can be modelled as there doesnt have to be single governing unifying top down process but multiple of them living in that single brain, or in the language of markov blankets it would be two interacting global markov blankets with their implementation being dependant on what model of the brain one chooses [OSF]([OSF]([OSF]([OSF](https://psyarxiv.com/6eqxh))))

or more generally, one can also use various predicted solutions to the binding problem out there (how you get unified experience from "distrinct" brain processes, what bounds an experience) and say that this is what breaks down in brains with multiple people living in it [Binding problem - Wikipedia]([Binding problem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_problem))
[Holonomic brain theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic_brain_theory)#Deep_and_surface_structure_of_memory [Quantum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum)_mind#David_Pearceele [Frontiers | Don‚Äôt forget the boundary problem!

How EM field topology can address the overlooked cousin to the binding problem for consciousness](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2023.1233119/full))))

plus its also true that there are various schools of thought that assume binding problem doesnt exist because they use completely different assumptions in math modelling or in ontology (instead of physicalism using idealism for example :D)
or assuming that all those solutions will have problems with really figuring out "true causality" or that its not graspable by mathematical modelling

==Usefulness of models==

Models are trying to find the most optimal ecosystem of bayesian priors all the way down üòÑ 

different evolutionary niches in our sensemaking that are result of many evolutionary influences [Epistemic Communities under Active Inference - PubMed]([Epistemic Communities under Active Inference - PubMed]([Epistemic Communities under Active Inference - PubMed]([Epistemic Communities under Active Inference - PubMed]([Epistemic Communities under Active Inference - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35455140/))))) 

in the uncertainity reduction paradigm, i converged onto model's usefullness being gathered from its predictivity, explanatory power, degree of universality, compressive power, how good it feels, in general how pragmatic for achieving goals (objective functions) it is for the individual or the collective (reducible to basic needs with lots of archetypes of selfactualization?) (cultural or spiritual frameworks are here on the collective scale)

and those parameters are different for different usecases - science wants predictivity at the cost of everything else for example, and sometimes we tend to fail there (for example sabine hossenfelder being angry at physics community following mathematical beauty too much in particle physics)
this is why i love raw bayesianism in science
[PaperStream #008.0 ~ An Active Inference Ontology for Decentralized Science (AEOS) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/F7GF0VsgdDc?feature==share)

plus i find it interesting how some models attempt to predict future but they end up forming future instead, descriptive vs prescriptive, lots of that is in sociology for example, and it can be in psychology as well in the form of psychotechnologies 

all models as useful abstractions, trying to grasp whats happening internally, conscious and subconscious processes

[[2302.06403] Sources of Richness and Ineffability for Phenomenally Conscious States]([[2302.06403] Sources of Richness and Ineffability for Phenomenally Conscious States]([[2302.06403] Sources of Richness and Ineffability for Phenomenally Conscious States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06403))) [- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==jXEJO_5g0ho) "Sources of Richness and Ineffability for Phenomenally Conscious States" - as in the paper, we cannot fully grasp our experience

==Science communication==

Science communication of physics to people that know almost no math is pretty hard, one has to use imagery and stories and analogies that somewhat slightly bring closer to or approximate it. Many argue if it makes it right or wrong.

I see a lot of arguing that sociology or philosophy could be often explained in less technical academic words. I would argue that the advantage of technical jargon is useful for encoding more complexity in a lot of situations, but also not always. Also if its maths then it can be simulated. But often people look for insights for everyday life in the studies and get bombared with the jargon they dont need in their context and get angry. Here science communication that approximately translates it to less jargon language is also needed IMO.

Also AI and consciousness is even more fun with the concensus chaos.

There's awareness, field of consciousness like a background spacetime, and interacting ecosystem of alters (subagents or processes in general) as the content in that, that tend to merge when there's enough correlation through interaction between them, but dont have to, or there can be some higherorder metaprocess that plays with those subprocesses also, being like a dirigent of orchestra of cats, and there can be multiple of those observing or governing dirigent or another higherorder governing dirigent directing the subdirigents. the governing structures dont have to be hiearchical and can also get circular or flat (when experiencing nothingness, there's none of those things). they can be formalized as interacting markov blankets with various degrees of complexity (inert particle, modeller, agentic acter,...) corresponding to nonlinearly interlocking activity of various neural populations  in the free energy principle paradigm ü§î and possibly math of neural field theory can be used - interacting nonlinear clusters of waves, shapes

We're not flooded by errors that are not predicted, or the sense that the errors are are predicted and therefore are not inherently suffering making. 

Amor Fati, that comes from Nietzsche, but originally goes back to Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, and in a sense is really the lens that Dzogchen, the great Perfection, is coming from.

"Now that we've talked about dissolving priors in the cortical hiearchy or dereifying concepts, reducing concept weights, seeing concepts as just nebulous mental constructions, by reducing stress, what is it to build back up a good predictive hierarchy? What's the practical take-home message there? Now that we've talked about breaking it down what do we do to build back up in the in a beautiful way? I think that as you say traditionally in contemplative systems the first part is to dissolve things to to the ground or to the groundless ground or to the absolute or to nothingness or whatever language one wants to use to see that everything's a construction and but you can't live from there. That might be like amazing, you could be in a a beautiful deep meditative absorption state of pure nothingness, pure light, minimum phenomenal experiences as Thomas Metzinger has coined it, but you can't live from there and so we have to come back and as we reconstruct the world, if we reconstruct the same crime same hierarchy we're back in the suffering, so what we have to do, along the way we get these insights, and we talked about the three marks of existence, the three characteristics, and those insights are that are for example traditional insights that can allow us to see the world in new and beautiful ways, in ways in which we're not flooded by errors that are not predicted, or the sense that the errors are are predicted and therefore are not inherently suffering making. 

But actually the landscape of priors that is possible is enormous, to put it in computational terms, the state space, that we can live within, is just this enormous conceptual landscape, this massive weight matrix of neural network weights of high-level priors, we can construct our world in many ways. Some of those priors will tend to be stable and some will not. We talked about the depressed persons prior being kind of self-reinforcing if I conceive of the world in a way that I'm a useless person, the world's an awful place, always everything goes wrong, and then I look at the world with that lens and I basically say what is the probability that the sensory data that I get, given that that I have this hypothesis, what's the probability that this conforms. And guess what, you find that the world turns out to be like that. You just pick up all this negative stuff, the world turns out to be awful, you see everything that goes wrong, and that's correct. But if on the other hand you have this optimistic beautiful world view that that the world's an amazing place, it's an absolute gift and a miracle, and it's just this absolutely beautiful passing show, and you look at the world through that lens, guess what? You're gonna live in the sacred world, you're going to live in this ecstatic beautiful place.

So I often give this. One of the most spectacular lenses which people can come to live is a lens that I call Amor Fati, that comes from Nietzsche, but originally goes back to Epictetus and and Marcus Aurelius, and in a sense I will say, is really the lens that Dzogchen, the great Perfection, is coming from. That is the lens that I love whatever is going to happen, whatever my fate is. And, you have this, you see the world, and you say, look! The world is absolutely amazing! It's perfect! Everything that is happening, I want it to happen, I want everything that's going to happen to happen, because it's all just perfect! And guess what! Everything does happen, exactly what happens, and you get what you want, and it's ecstatic! Because you're totally fulfilled, the world is just unfolding in some sort of perfect way, and actually, you know, we really can't tune into this. Even this sort of difficulty of suffering and that we see in the world is part of an overall system of the fact that we can even get out of suffering! And in a forest you're going to have a beautiful flourishing forest and part of that almost entails that there'll be some trees that will be more shaded by other trees that are trying to grow and that way species virgin. So there is this Amor Fati lens, and it is exquisite to live within these lenses. 

I would say that they are stable equilibria that can be constructed in the sense that these priors reinforce themselves. You can't just put in any priors that are not in some sense validated through Bayesian updating. So what we have to see is that the way of looking at the world reinforces that way of looking at the world. These are things that have been discovered over thousands of years of wisdom and they're beautiful ways of living. Now we're just coming up against maybe one of the reasons why religion has been so useful for us because I guess religions convey some of these high-level priors that when installed are self-fueling in beautiful ways. Like, we've learned over thousands of years, what kind of priors, when installed, help us manage the volatility of our environment, in ways that make our lives beautiful. Let's think through some of the big religions, some of the big spiritual movements, and see what priors they're installing."<ref>[[- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v==ruH3KYcPoDE) Constructing Our Lives: with Dr Shamil Chandaria]</ref>

==Personal message to everyone==

I started with early complex post traumatic stress disorder from dissonant social experiences, sensory overload, hyperanalysis, overfitting, attentional issues, hyperactivity, empathic emotional deficit, impulsive addictive behavior, anxious-like qualities combo dissonantly interacting with the environment in selfreinforcing feedback loop way that works differently than my organism in this sense combined with first bad trip thanks to unprepared set and setting and spiraling into dissonance, all of which lead to tons of hebbian canalizations over my whole brain as a response to threatening adversity while studying everything from neuroscience to philosophy an attempt to help myself as I was all over the place with milions of perspectives interacting in the space of the mind mine not really unified. But also out of neverending curiousity!

Then by studying unifying metatheories and doing nondual attentional relaxing meditative psychedelic deconstructive and lovingly unifying constructive activities I increased tempature mediated metametaframeworkian plasticity that allowed my organism to interconnect and merge all the canals into one giant metametatheoretic structure that I'm writing in my book, merging all my disconnected subagents or wavey cloudy raw sensations or mentally constructed linguistic or mental models and simulations in general inside into one empty but full interconnected field that is calmed and stable by swimming in loving caring childlike light cute playful deep vast compassionate still spacious free groundless ground that is beyond language, concepts or abstract thought where all beings are spacetimelessly one in the womb of awareness creation that is putting my subagents in unified cooperative harmony and feels divinely comforting where I can be or do "normal human things" or write about all of this without attention everywhere and other things in peace if something way too destabilizing hasnt happened that day. ‚ù§Ô∏è 

There is definitely still more potential to engineer and train the skill to feel unification, learning to love and accept what is, be equaminous in way more external and internal conditions than now, dissolve or transform more learned dissonant conditioned reactions, its still an unfolding healing and overall improvement process, nobody is ever flawless and selfimprovement and wellbeing engineering technically has no upper bound! 

Plus I wanna also help everyone with mental discomfort and smoothen, fill the spiky dissonant dark void made of subagents with fullfillment, selfactualization and light, give it breadcrumbs of love and understanding, using these tools I've researched into as effectively as possible, so that's why I'm looking into how can all of this be effectively applied at scale and globally heal and increase the total wellbeing of population and evolve together, effectively mitigate existencial risks, go towards consciousness wellbeing utopia full of mutual compatibility and smooth frictionless coordination, full of freedom for everyone, together as unified humanity or life in general! Let's be healthy, happy, creative, productive, loving together in the quest of making our inner and outer world a better place! üíñ

==Summary==

In this book which is my Magnum Opus I:

- Lay out nonreductive theory of everything based on quantum field theory and the free energy principle and interconnect it with various mathematical methodologies, approaches and fields, such as harmonic analysis

- I put express various relatedness and isomorphisms between various neurophenomenological (the study of the brain and interconnecting it with the experience) models (brain network model, predictive processing, connectome harmonics, topology) and unify them into one model

- I explain how wellbeing, happiness, meditation, psychedelics, mental discomfort, philosophy, pleasure, enlightenment is understood using this framework (reducing uncertainity by consonant symmetrical activity)

- Go over the existing "what is fundamental" ontological discussions inside and outside of academia (physics, consciousness, unification of those, something third, transcedence of this way of thinking - only prepdictivity of models matters)

- Based on this research, I give suggestions on how to solve the metacrisis (statistical physics flavoured evolutionary game theory to global social system to navigate the interconnected landscape of existencial risks for humanity in order to find evolutionary stable strategic longterm solutions of not selfdecostructing ourselves soon with stuff like nuclear war, climate change or bio/cyberweapons because of caring for individual short term safety instead of global long term safety) and the meaning crisis by social systems optimized for happiness (slowly transforming the system in better conditions for coordination by for example bigger transparency and for wellbeing by for example denormalizing chronic stress and normalizing cleaning the mind, normalizing states of consciousness high in wellbeing such as Jhanas or 5-MeO-DMT), implications for artificial general intelligence and alignment (inspiration on how people synchronize their vibes from neuroscience)

- Based on this research, I lay out a full stack protocol on engineering wellbeing using deconstructive and constructive meditation, psychedelics and ways of thinking (equaminity, nonduality, love, perfectness, cultivating symmetrification of neurophenomenology), how to heal trauma and align DMT entities 

- Based on this way of thinking, I suggest definitions for certain philosophical constructs such as truth (certain configurations of sensations or of the brain dynamics), and how to liberate the thinking mind with philosophy (transcendence of all concepts by middle waying everything)

What types of labelling systematizing systems leads to heaven realm states of mind and how to paradise engineer it‚Äôs emergence and how to engineer the emergence of the engineering itself and so on? Do you want these things? Not being lost in life. Knowing what you‚Äôre doing. Being happy with your life. Making people you care about happy. Not feel lonely. Feel accepted. Feel peace. Understand the world and others. Enjoy doing stuff. Not be lazy. Be motivated. Have energy. Be the best person. Let‚Äôs find out how to achieve that. What practical implications does neural annealing model have for mental wellbeing? What are the best algorithms to maximize the most optimal parameters in the space of mental wellbeing in time? What does interpreting empiric data under direct realism and qualia constructivism philosophical framework tell us about achieving states of mind close to platonic hedonistic states of mind? How to find truth, hapiness, peace for our soul manifesting itself in the physical world? In the space of all attractors existing now, what factor attractors fuel the best mental wellbeing mind attractors? How to get to enlightenement? |
In order to understand how things work, let‚Äôs first figure out how our brains understand anything in the first place. 

So, what do we find ourselves in? We suddenly popped into existence with a body that we can control and there are things around us happening everyday and we make sense of it and try to find what‚Äôs the best for us with our limited energy. Something is bad? Avoid it. Something is good? Keep looking for it. How do we see if something is good or bad, how do we know that it works? Experience, intuition, someone telling us and convincing us. What things do we want to do? Good things we know that work or new stuff that isnt repetetive. This is crucial. Being happy works? Let‚Äôs continue. Being sad works? Let‚Äôs continue. Being optimistic works? Let‚Äôs continue. Being pessimistic works? Let‚Äôs continue. We know this idea works? Let‚Äôs try to realise it!
We‚Äôre supposted to do what? What‚Äôs the purpose of it all? Is there even something like a purpose? Is there meaning of life? Or how do our brains create meaning in life? 

I make a lot of claims in this book. Some of them are hypothesis extensions from empirical data based models that might or might not correspond to empiric data if the prediction would be put to an experiment. Or it‚Äôs neutral play.


Everything and nothing 

So, what is the most abstract and general thing? The theory of everything? In order to explain everything you need to explain nothing. In the most general structure, everything can be true. 
For example absolute nonexistence of experiences, illusionism, or absolute epistemological agnocisism, antirealism, say that nothing is fundamentally true or real, which itself is true or real. 
This is amazing philosophically, because you can gain understanding of any thought construct thanks to being able to anneal into any possible structure. 


Thinking 

If we switch to more pragmatism, what is the only thing we can directly measure? There is some experience. And some contents of experience. Different modalities of experience. Thoughts themselves live in this space, also also philosophical thoughts. Let‚Äôs break down different kinds of thought modalities. There‚Äôs pure unconstrained thinking. Then there‚Äôs art and pure philosophy which can be considered as thinking that is constrained by at least some structure. Academic philosophy constains it by some academic rigorousity. Mathematics constrains it by formal consistency. Then computation constraints that by computability. Or physics constraints that by data measured from physical reality. The more abstract science field gets, the more abstract factor analysis on top of data you have to do and lose predictive accuracy and gain chaotic nonlinear complexity.
Fundamentally all minds in themselves and languages are doing is labeling attractors. 


Chaos language

Everything is just study of avarages over a chaotic system. Linear deterministic systems are attractors in a system that itself has nonlinear chaotic properties. Even more, it‚Äôs attractors in categories of intuition. Attractors themselves live in an atractor space and those too up to infinity. 
Fun thing is, we can also explain the dynamics of philosophy itself in this language. But from philosophical assumptions that there is something and that classical causality is special case of interaction of attractors. One attractor attracts other attractor and no other attractors play a role. Just like how the cause of existence of the intuition of causality we have can be explained in the language of causality, we can explain attractor language by the attractor language itself.
This theory creates selfsimilarities at all scales and levels of abstractions of the reality explaining reality as one giant interconnected fractals of fractals. I claim that anything can be desribed in this language. Every other language is just some approximation in some modalities over this pure happenings having different types of possible implications and ways of more modelling over available data and predicting more data through explorative theory building. One can freely switch from low level chaos to different high level languages back and forth in the same sentence depending what feels good. Two dynamics are same, similar, isomorphic, have a 1:1 correspondence in terms of some abstraction when that abstraction over the two cases of dynamicds yiels the same result. Mathematics, programs, game theory, philosophy, causality, classic language, psychology, evolution, etc. are just abstractions over the chaos dynamics.


Chaos modelling

For example what that can be desribed in this language is the dynamics of mind or the evolution of life. Crab is the ultimate lifeform, a perfect attractor, just like how love is. Or evolution of art, music, political, epistemological, ethical, ontological, religious, social construct, language, model, any knowledge, univese, galaxy, planetary, atmosphere, human, animal, plant, ant, soil systems. Scientific, mathematical, code paradigms ‚Äì it‚Äôs all trends like any other trend. Art style is like an ideology. Language is like a galaxy. Religion is like an animal. Ant is like a neuron. Thought is like a star. Cell is like a particle. Skill is like species. Category theory is like buddhism. The concept of everything is the sun of the universe. Anything is like a wave in an ocean. They are all systems of attractors in their own with different properties, some are linear, some have static laws and structures, some are deterministic, some are nicely apprimated when assumed as closed, some are open system so they interact with systems around them, all creating one unified system. The attractors that are the most stable stay and get their labels. If the concept of religion itself wasn‚Äôt attracted in some modality, then it wouldn‚Äôt be stable and dissolve and no such concept would exist, same for cats, shapes of solar systems, a math theory or structure of ant colonies. They combine nonlineary and phenomena like convergent evolution happens. They maximize fitness, adapting to the environment by knowing how to respond to it by modelling it in some simplified way reducing the element of surprise. Too complex modelling can get too specialized and not general enough, therefore it has space for too many edge cases, and takes more resources. Too general modelling on the other hand doesnt capture enough complexity, sometimes the resources from which the modelling emerges are more cost benefitial in the long run and the system stays for longer. Synthesis of two systems happen everywhere, as we can see with political ideologies for example. 
Unifications of paradigms in science are synthesis of existing attractors into one, for example recent qualita formalism in mathematical neuroscientific modelling of consciousness is synthesis of different points of view of the data from the measurement of the nervous system and qualia into one with strong predictability power in a lot of modalities just like topos theory is a unification of different ways of looking at math. Many modalities merge into one, but every constructed point of view will solve some problems in some modalities better and in some worse. That implies it's so extremely hard to create a model in every modality space at one and I suspect we will never solve everything with absolute accuracy because for that we would need a theory of everything because it is a closed system and I suspect that would need infinite time and computability power and resolution or approximation of problems equivalent with the halting problem, like the spectral gap, in practice, and a separate model for all possible evolution of states of the universe because of the nuances in states that can get compressed into generalized models specialized for certain modalities always lose some complexity and interconnectedness with abstraction happening. They all are approximations of different topological attractors at some layers of abstraction and physics is great at that. Quantum mechanics on a low level, general relativity on a high level. It‚Äôs so hard to find attractors through layers of abstraction corresponding to the bridge between them and unify them in a nice way through classical mathematical means, maybe because they are approximations of different layers of abstraction that can be very nicely approximated as a closed system in terms of layers of abstraction because the attractors don‚Äôt interact with each other as much as we would expect and therefore it‚Äôs not so easily approximated in an interconnected way, but a lot of different approaches on the unification exist and are still emerging. Any systems of attractors considered form a new system of attractors. Some constructions more trivial or pragmatic than others. You can get to any possible meta level. Model the evolution of modelling the evoltions of modelling the mind or the evolution of different ways of thinking about different ways of thinking.


Mind

Let‚Äôs dig into the mind. A mind in time can be modelled as a space in which attractors collaborate and fight with eachother. Sensory information can spawn an attractor that can either get consumed by existing attractors, for example someone complimenting you can get integrated by an attractor that corresponds to the self model in a positive valence way. When problem solving problem, a nice dance of nonlinear selforganization of attractors around eachother plays out corresponding a very pretty attractor whole. Any problem solving in any modalities can be formalised as this memeplex play, where memeplexes correspond to labeling approximations of the underlying dynamics. 

We all algorithmize and approximate the pure underlying nature, of pure dynamics, of pure god, of pure everything, pure humanly ungraspable something we can label as anything we want. Everything we can think of is just a useful approximation/model/illusion/however you call it of the underlying world. Including our egos (self models), our world models in general, our social construct models. We maximize our own underlying forces we call basic needs with approximations over them as models and frameworks. 


Mind formation

Let‚Äôs slowly construct the mind. At first, there is no mind, just like there is no universe. Then an empty mind pops into existence, just like space, along with a lot of unorganized chaotic energy, just like when universe was infinitely small. And then it starts getting structure. Maybe the birth and evolution of the human being is fully analogous to the the evolution of species or universes, since it‚Äôs all about maximizing fitness. We come with our genes and epigenetics, that predispose us to certain probabilities of convergences to certain body and mind architectures. Different interconnected sequences of genes, using the past and current sensory input,  really restrict the probability of the neurvous system selforganizing in a way of some possible experiences and opens the possibility of others. After popping into existence, this starts to get formed. In the beginning of the human evolution, there is more inner chaos which leads to easier dynamical updating of the self and world model through time. In a sense it‚Äôs like kids being constantly like adults but on some dose of LSD. The more we age, the easier it is for our minds to become less chaotic, with some exceptions, because exceptions are everywhere in this chaotic dynamical system modelling, the more we tend to converge to a certain fixed belief system with a self and a world model and the harder for us it is to get out of the local minima of experience we converge into. Different people converge into different types of local minima. At first, everything is unknown to us, everything is just a variable. Then we collect memetics from the environment and nonlineary evolutionary dance them in our mind into a unified structure, such as the goodness and badness of certain toys, people or groups, pragmatic tools, food, nonspirituallike or spirituallike concepts, morals, types of statuses of certain people, ontologies. Some concepts are constructed in the attention awareness, some in the back of our mind but still can be read by the conscious space, some selfmetaprogramming processes work only in the subconscious and can be slightly revealed or communicated with using meditation or certain substances, like inner algorithms, inner gods, higher selfs or DMT entities. Some parts of the brain‚Äôs model of everything are mostly given by the environment, some are mostly given by the genes, but it‚Äôs always some kind of complex interconnected combination of both. One can possibly anneal into models that have mostly positive or negative high or low energy local minima experiences or some dynamic combinations of those. We can look at the extremes. There‚Äôs depression with very low amount of high energy state, then depression with mostly high energy negative states, and then a hydra called bipolar disorder, which is basically oscilating between high energy negative and positive valence experiences. Winning life might be living in constant high energy positive valence experiences that arent too far different from other people‚Äôs experiences, so that one still can feel like he belongs, being the optimistic positive type spreading love.


Enlightenement

Metamodelling

When modelling political ideologies to create stability and harmony according to our individual basic needs, we often make assumption such as ubreakable causal chains, determinism, linearity, dynamics that aren‚Äôt chaotic aka small input changes don‚Äôt create drastically different outcomes. Our brains don‚Äôt want to grasp the chaotic dynamics of the real world in those cases. We try to deterministically assume what humans maximize, but there‚Äôs an issue there too. It‚Äôs a complex interconnected system of approximations over basic needs and different memeplexes that anyone was infected with.  Every model is an attempt on satysfying our basic needs on the individual or community or global, including animals and nature etc. level, we sometimes model nature as us not living in it like anything else but bothering it with our existence, seeing ourselves as a virus instead of part of it. In the language of dynamical systems, a virus is just an atom object. Any thought is in some sense also a virus as memetics model it. Different models dont model thoughts as viruses and therfore create better connotation structures. We have models around hunger, feeling included, status, not dying, not feeling restricted, feeling safe. All of those correspnding to our inner mechanisms, different genes, different other memeplexes, different neurobiology. Not feeling restricted can correspond to openness to experience or your fun algorithms specialize in certain modalities that are not being allowed in current system so you anneal to the complete destroyment of the restriction system. I would argue that game theoretically there would be an emergence of less centralised wanting to control equilibria competing with eachother. On some point this is what states are now anyway, but more centralised and regulated in certain parts of the world more than in others.
 

Learning

Back to psychology, our brains seem to do two approximated factor analysis attractor things when learning new things that gradually convert from one to other. At first, we create bins for possible topics. Philosophy, mathematics, physics, psychology, etc. just like our school system divides the parts of knowledge into lessons. In each topic, we first start from creating simple this phenomena causes this phenomena bins in causality modelling language from eighter our own observation or someone telling us. Then the more coorelations and causalities we observe, the more we interconnect it all together and start making more and more structure. Then the language of philosophy, logic, mathematics can abstract different common patterns among this structure into formalised everywhere existing many structures that satisfy things like no fuziness or polycontextuality in classical set theory mathematics on the first few years of university level. Or in classical language we observe some common patterns, like people wanting food and safety, and set those as axioms from which causality chains to different results emerge. This is great style of modelling for classical attractors. We assume certain causality axioms, absolute objective truths for anything ‚Äì mathematics, logic, sychology, economy, nature, politics, programming styles and then take them as the absolute from which heverything emerges. Christians see bible as fundamental. Category theorists love category theory in this way. I love my chaos language that I am open to generalise to more. And from that all systems are created. Systems that maximize efficiency in stability win and are kept. Those who are not stable dont survivse for long. Thanks to this certain stable equlibria systems of memeplexes emerge. 


Stability

The ones that maximize stability that are approximation of basic needs are those who rely on the axiom that each human is equal to other human when it comes to rights, which is a lot enforced in the current EU, and also need to belong on the community level is enforced, same with destroction of certain social constructs that used to be more stable equilibria back in the days. The most dominant and fundamentalistic, nonrelativistic religions like Christianity and Islam spread and are stable so well because of its properties. You really hardcore into human brains this system of deterministic axiomatic causalitions so well because it written in stories and human brains through the history were adapted on creating their world model behavior algorithmic structure that takes some input and gives some output from this story structure which I would say the more aligned to culture it is, the more chance is has penetrating the pattern recognition system on the level of memeplex. Many things can happen. A perfect belief system energy sink match is basically what we label as confirmation bias, you more and more anneal to that belief system structure because you see more and more data around you having this structure. This is from the point of bayesian statistics completely expected behavior of information processing systems. I would say if you match most of the confirmation bias energy sinks but then edit some small part and constantly reinforce it, yo ucan slowly but surely edit the belief system. The more axiomatic it is, the harder will it be to shift the belief system in the state space of all attractor systems to attractors that are more aligned with the buddha vector aka the property of the attractor to be general therefore easily changeable to concrete others. 


Worldviews

There‚Äôs also this psychology of trying to be better than the other generation, which is defence mechanism such that it‚Äôs escaping from childhood formed negative valence attractors. I myself this way annealed into absolute relativity framed by positive valence story structure by never liking any epistemological barries that humans do. But they emerge for a reason, they‚Äôre creating stable society, when as many people as possible are aligned on the same values, morals, ontology etc., and when ideologies that are unstable are only in small percentage of population‚Äôs minds, its fine, they become a threat when more and more people anneal to them. Community synchronized stability is harder to achieve but still works in today‚Äôs population, because the internet created a global spread of memeplexes from all parts of the world to all parts of the world, creating a global memeplex network. Before the memeplexes emerged and were contained much more localy and nationality enforcing memeplexes stayed stable and got less stable as the system grew and got interconnected, because for a big interconnected system, equality creates some sort of stability on the classical society level. If capitalism emerges, then there‚Äôs group maximizing game theoretic things but not rationally as modern game theory assumes, but also there‚Äôs human level like irrationality in there and fuzzy chaos. Most modern spiritual religions are synthesis of many existing memeplexes.

 
Metametamodelling

My mind, this whole book is synthesis of as many most meta memeplexes that I could find anywhere on the internet and I‚Äôm still looking for more. At one point when searching for meta memeplexes you notice how so many of them are on the same meta level and have so many similarities that can be formalised, in my case in my chaos attractor language which abstracts away from the meta levels themselves as well. It‚Äôs interesting how policital systems come in waves. When one emerges, is stable for a while and then collapses because entropy had to be garbage collected, a slightly different one emerges, maybe less stable one if the system forgets the search for stability that was maybe too long time ago. As you can see this logic can be also applied to how brain forms models. This logic is scale free. Let‚Äôs see different phenomena in epistemological frameworks that we see today. Afterall all frameworks are connected to our universal needs. There‚Äôs many things which a framework can maximize. Today‚Äôs most common frameworks maximize everything in current cultural sense. 


Mind metaattractors

There are two extremes that are interesting to analyze, one is absolute scientific darwinian analytical mathematical dynamical look at all phenomena, which is maximizing predictibility power of the future or past states of the system. Eighter specializing in one extremely concrete field, microbiology for example, or systematizing all possible systematization systems, as neutral as possible, in the language of mathematics, modelling frameworks that predict things, with as least as possible structural story, just pure as neutral as possible models, where most popular having assumtions that matter is primary, because for pragmatic reasons it predicts stuff pretty well, or one can postulate that mind contents are primary, or that information is primary, from which its pragmatic to model the mind as a machine somehow making sense from some sensory data and learning from it. Or my way of trying to combine all possible scientific fields and philosophical frameworks analytically for example. Then there‚Äôs second extreme, which isnt maximilizing predictibility power at any cost, but the positive valence of experience. Anything that will create as much synchrony as possible not with the real world data, but with the nervous system, is integrated. Religion, language of algorithms in simulation hypothesis, ideologies, stories about the world are maximalizing inner synchrony with causal determinism and pure structure.

 
Double metaattractor

Interesting to observe when you reach a stable positive valence global attractor state on meditation, which isn't a metaattractor that is destabilizing all other attractors that much, but it's integrating them instead, that you keep after meditation for a while, how a lot of potential negative smaller attractors afterward get converted into positive valence attractors if it's in the space of predictable negative valence attractors corresponding to a substtractor of the global attractor which is eating, converting, integrating it but if a very unpredictable negative valence attractor emerges from sensory data it fails to get integrated and instead there's a competing negative valence attractor with the positive valence attractor which creates a state of mind that has both pretty big positive and negative valence properties. Reminds me of how 5-MeO-DMT bad trip is described as two competing attractors creating dissonance.

 
Happy life

To lead a happy life, one must find to what he is adapted to. Genes are something like an abstract mathematical structure. It‚Äôs a framework that takes an input and creates an output under certain rules. Which foods and how we exercise creates our body and mind. But one thing that I feel like is very underrepresented, because its not thought about as systematically, is the power of memetics. Different people are more attracted towards different attractors of memetics than other people. Their mind is from both nature and nurture adapted to certain memetic attractors. The nurture part here is very important. All those stories about people going from being depressed and unmotivated and without meaning to being happy and motivated with positive future to come. They just went from one framework of thought that eighter wasnt compatible with a lot of their other parts or was just pure nihilism to frameworks of thought that model your environment and yourself as a progressing entity getting better and better, therefore creating the motivation signals. Without this, there‚Äôs no circuitry in the brain that would create the association with better or positive valence in general future states of mind. I think a lot of people in our current society that maximilize predictivity power got into this trap. They also according to data about climate change or microplastics or subsribed to the idea that capitalism will collapse into anarchy or the poslar opposite idea that communism will take over europe or that Russia will expand over Europe. They all might be accurate preditions, they also might not, they create activism so that those problems can be solved, which is nice, but not everyone can be consumed by this, which I think creates the global lose of meaning and depression as consequences, scientifically neutral or negative framing of everything, because on the level of individual or community that tries to build motivated positive valence experiences, putting most attention to just possible disasters or negative valence memeplexes in general destroys the possibility for motivation or positivity inducing memeplexes to emerge and take control as metaalgorithms. If you surroud your and your community‚Äôs mind with positive motiovation generating memeplexes, which a lot of religions do by default and thats why they‚Äôre so valued, you can make new minds anneal into positive motivated worldviews. 


Fixing the mind

With minds, which have already extremely deeply annealed into the negative valence worldview, with enough energy they can be reannealed into better ones. There are many ways. Psychoteraphy works for some people. Change of environment works for some people, but not for everyone. Some people are so deep that they are lost in cynicism. With enough emotional stimulation energy though, their minds can stretch and create a new worldview. Negative worldviews can also be something like metatraumas. Your mind is constantly adapting, creating patterns from sensory data and reinforcing or overwriting or creating new algorithms in mind. Meditation techniques train many things. Unifying confliting algorithms. Creating more symmetric shapes of the algorithms, which leads to positive valence. A metattractor so general that it dissolves or integrates all other possible emerging attractors. Incrementary dissolvance of some negative valence attractors manifested as traumas. Proper neurobiology is always needed. If your neurobiology is lacking some neurotransmitters that much that their creation cant get stimulated by memeplexes, then neurotechnology like rewiring or drugs are needed. Overall traumas tend to selforganize neurons in a way which blocks living through basic needs and therefore one never feels the satisfiction because the shared fundamentals with everyone of his neurocircuitry doesn‚Äôt get stimulated and sends negative signals in the form of anxiety or depression. All those methods dont have to be used only to get from bad system to a functioning one. They all can be used to create better states of mind from any current state of mind. The issue here is that some traumatic negative valence attractors are too hidden under the defence mechanism complexity built on top of it trying to escape from it, which in some cases subconsciously reinforces them but in other cases can make them dissolve, depending on the structure of the complexity built on top of it. That can create symtoms which can be treated by for example SSRIs and benzos, and benzos withdrawals tend to be much worse. Another issue might be that they‚Äôre too strong to dissolve, change their valence, integrate into a more positive valence metaattractor etc. using just pure power of memetics. Here substance assisted psychotheraphy can be used. Theraphies with Ketamine, MDMA, Ayahuaca, LSD etc. show promising results there. Their very complex mechanisms creating certain selforganization states of mind yielding different phenomological data are very nice. Dissocatives implicitly relax all possible attractors, which in some cases with the power of strong metaattractor memetics can be saved for longer than just under the influence of the substance. 


Substances

Psychedelics create big amounts of motivated semantically neutral energy which in return creates a lot of annealing processes, that can reinforce, relax, replace existing beliefs, depending on your current metameme structure. The stronger metameme you have, the less likely you will relax it and you‚Äôll supercharge it instead. DMT tends to make you abstractly overfit your ontology metamemeplexes and put it all in a beautiful extremely complex interconnected story about you, universe and so on. 5-MeO-DMT tends to make you underfit instead and relaxes all possible structure into one global positive valence attractor in which you see the concept of everything. Stimulants reinforce concrete overfitting, which is why they‚Äôre so good for concrete learning. Substance, set, setting and dose dictates on what metalevel of memeplexes you fly in in which modalities, closer or more far away from concerete modelling of the universal basic needs. 


Better state

This also applies without any substances. Set and setting dictates on what memeplexes you inhibit your model of reality in. Neurobiology itself dictates the space of all possible mind states. It‚Äôs not constant. It‚Äôs dynamic. It changes with new memeplexes and with different substances that come from classical food aswell. Neuroprotective foods also make the selforganizing mechanisms and everything more healthy too. Someone being open to everything is having a metamemeplex which every other memeplex can be in. Different people put different restrictions to this metamemeplex. I am open in the space of all possible memeplexes. Big subset of scientists are mostly open on the level of memeplexes having predictive power. Spiritual people are open on those maximizing positive valence. Certain ideologies create a different subspace of all memeplexes too. Anarchism tends towards memeplexes destroying hiearchy. Authoritianism towards domination. Personality traits can emerge from all those memeplexes or they fuel other memeplexes. They create emergence or collapse into meta ones. Some of them specialize better than others. Some of them are more dynamical than others. Some of them are more motivating. 


Happy reality

In some sense your whole reality is one giant approximation. The sense of self, environment, objects, truths, time and space can be warped using different mind configurations in many ways. If one wants to engineer an optimal solution to life, he has to consier all possible factors. If one already has this infinitemetamemeplex that relativizes everything, it can make one feel empty. That‚Äôs why when consuming predictive metamemeplexes, it‚Äôs great to consume ones framed in positive valence story framework, it‚Äôs also great to consume ones that have as much reinforced inner structure to coorporate with others as possible, the ones that have community around them, the ones that yield pragmatic ways of implementing those positive valence experiences in group, because without group, an individual can implement only so much and is limited to only his knowledne and his mind and is not satifying the need for belonging because we‚Äôre optimized for socializing. 


My ideal community

This can be many frameworks, one such that seems to be the most optimal for people with high annealing parameter given by nature and nurture is this one. Exploring the realms of analyzing the mind and the world is exploring the god‚Äôs, nature‚Äôs simulation‚Äôs creator‚Äôs or whatever‚Äôs inner approximated structure. We‚Äôre in some sense all that thing. One unified thing, because reality isnt just sum of its parts. Things depend on eachother, there‚Äôs some kind of connection between anything, said mathematically in the language of fractals for example.  Without any part of it the reality wouldn‚Äôt work. Everyone is part of everything. Let‚Äôs collaborate on engineering the paradise through the lens of both rationality and spirituality in this complex system we call nature. Let‚Äôs eliminate the negative extremes through the means of memetics and all other possible neurotechnology. Let‚Äôs reinforce patterns in behavior that are linked to better physical and mental health, such as meditation, healthy food, exercise or social gathering. Let‚Äôs socially conduct all possible acitivities and technologies linked to raising the energy levels of the brain and therefore making our nervous systems healthy. Let‚Äôs cooperate on building those technologies or belief systems. Let‚Äôs analyze things not only in short term means, but also in long term means. For example let‚Äôs accumulate pleasure through the whole day through reinforcing behaviours which empirically yield better mental wellbeing in the long term. Let‚Äôs create technology based on predictive power models. Let‚Äôs create interesting stories about the world around us by maximing interstingness. Let‚Äôs use the power of feedback loop to design a better world. Let‚Äôs model the past and future as positive valence progress, where we learn from mistakes and sharpen our models. Let‚Äôs reinforce not getting stuck into negative valence attractors. Let‚Äôs maximize not forced productivity. 


For everyone

This is one possible path. If one cannot anneal into motivated productive state for paradise engineering, one can be the one who gets help from the engineers without needing to help back in the realm of engineering, just as not everyone is a doctor. Let‚Äôs engineer memeplexes specialized for certain people in theraphy. Let‚Äôs use the power of neurotechnology like substances to help those people anneal more positive valence generating aligned memeplexes, just like tribal cultures were doing it. Let‚Äôs tolerate the existence of other possible maximizing paradigms in our world such as postulating that suffering is fundamental and let those be if they dont want to get aligned. Let‚Äôs tolerate all other possible systems when it doesnt directly negatively affect us, like wanting to overtake and dominate us with different maximalization algorithms. Let‚Äôs have those metaprocess in our brain: one attracting us to social groups with as many compabilities to us as possible to motivationaly work together on the same goal, second one relativizing all possible states of mind so that empirical analyzation and modelling is possible, third one putting everything into philosophical framework stories making it easier to anneal, where states of mind are possible manifestations emerging from this everything encompassing nature divine laws and having some approximations of attractors that cause the emergence of positive valence states of mind and manifest and engineer those methods in us. This is for people that are optimised for communities. I would label the community under this framework as transhumanistic hedonistic neobuddhistic hippies. Effective altruists are pretty close to this. If one wants to work individually instead of on the level of a community, he can anneal all of those values on an individual level as contents of his self model. But the more individual one makes it, the more lonely he can feel. Interconnectedness of the self model to the model of the environment satisfies the need for belonging. But if one anneals his interconnectedness to nature by treating nature on the same level as other people, so modelling it like modelling interconnectedness to other people, this need can be satisfied while being individual. The metamemeplex I‚Äôm telling has people as part of nature, as its manifestation. Or both at the same time is great too. But the more brain is specialised, the better it anneals in that domain, the more it lives through the concrete experiences. If brain is specialised on the most general level, then it lives reality mostly through those lens. Both work and yield positive valence experiences when framed in  positive valence optimized framework. Living in noise without any framing is not good for the nervous system. 


Generalised chaos

This might not be end goal, there is probably more to all of this, let‚Äôs ascend to more universes, maybe there are more ways to abstract over all existing ways of thinking and then all those could maybe be abstracted futher without overfitting or underfitting. But as Kant said, it‚Äôs still most likely plays in our sensory information processing hardware and software and there‚Äôs isnt an information processing hardware such that all complexities of the reality could be compressed in. Maybe for each possible hardwirable compression way aka categories of intuition you could create a model in some extremely unified category. When the evolution of the chaos modelling paradigm itself can be modelled by itself, let‚Äôs take the space of all possible modelling paradigms. If me as a prediction machine wanting the most positive valence for itself and other beings, wanting stability and cooperation so that those positive valence methods of designing belief systems or creating pragmatic empiric methods from models of the brain can flourish, wanting the most interesting exepriences full of the most interesting complexity. If we try to apply this under the classical framework from which we model physics combined with from what thoughts Lovecraft or Wittgenstein was coming from. We have this ungraspable concept of something, let it be under certain approximations some liquid, mathematics, nature, universe, chaos, concept of unknown, subtrate, code, simulation, creator, god, gods, angel, Cthulu, everything, anything, something, superposition of all of those concepts. And we try to approximate over it with all possible thought conctructions that our minds are capable of thanks to their in some ways shared structure. We anneal the patterns so nicely into our neural classifiers that we believe it‚Äôs existence constituents for the existence of our inner and outer world, and even this classification of the inner and outer can break down with meditation for example. All barries can break down and create pure unification of everything in one. My most functioning approximation of this mind state is an abstract algebraic structure without any restrictions applied to it, a blank canvas. Even in physics, we say that theory of relativity creates the canvas, the spacetime in which anything can exist, and quantum mechanics draws on that canvas with particles encoded as wave functions, nice waves of paint. Quantum field theory then picks out each paint color and structure into it‚Äôs own canvases from which the final canvas is merged into. This concept of unknown is something that creates us and itself, because we are it and it is us. A drawing that creates and paints itself.

Shape of dynamics


Maybe this kind of structure is what is emerging when we do pure statistics over data without any human-like structure in neural networks? We just need to find the right language for approximating its dynamics, maybe nonlinear polycontextual fuzzy logic, just like how brain does bayesian inference? Can they in theory learn any possible dynamics, or they fundamentally specialise only in some modality space of attractors and everything wont emerge even when trained optimally infinitely? When we jump from neural networks to less general methods in data science, when we try to find common patterns among some data, we can do factor analysis using linear regression and principal component analysis. Big five model of personalities is pretty good dimension reduction when it comes to personalities, those are also attractors. It could be reduced to just two. It could be reduced to way more many. The more spectrums we add, the more complexity we get. Again, we can overfit or underfit. We add more structure, like subspectrums or any hiearchical set or category theoretic model hiearchy. We can specialize in different modalities. Data can be noneuclidian, not normally distributed, logaritmic. 

Fuzzy polycontextual logic


All of this can be encoded in the shapes and sizes and attractor relations between different attractors in a similar way like infinity category theory does it in deterministic way, this can be in polycontextual fuzzy way. Can nonlinear polycontextual fuzzy logic be the most general approximation of pure topological attractor dynamics? In neural network architectures, multiple layers of attention mechanisms, similar to human attention in layers of modalities, are used, where every layer picks up some combination of some patterns. Attention between attentions, multiple layers of attention on top of attention layers would be metaattention. Just like humans create attention on top of attention. Or neural networks on top of neural networks. Let‚Äôs formalise bayesian inference.

Story about the god of chaotic abstraction wantering the space of all existences

Dissecting an abstract optimizing compatibility with environment nihilistic song into healthy optimistic framework
How to get everyone to like you
Step one
Be agreeable
When anyone says anything
Nod your head
Doesn't even matter what they said
Just show 'em what they wanna see
"Wow, I agree with everything you just said"
"Wow, this guy's alright!"
"Cool."
Repeat until dead

This is easy. It has many disadvantages at first rhough. You still have some individual worldviews and the incompatible memeplexes with your annealed selforganized structure that others shoot at your senses cause physical pain. This disadvantage dissapears when you ultimately generalize your worldview.

Step two
Never voice a complaint
Because we all know that opinions are tainted

This is the crucial part of building a constantly activated metaprocess attractor eating all sensory data connected to the positive valence centers in the brain. When under indirect realistic brains as information processing entities you see how every single world model is just a useful approximation of sensory data directed towards subjective values of universal basic needs, you notice how every person annealed to a different approximation and it makes sense that they did, since it converged into the space that is most compatible with their inner pressures in most cases. Some people‚Äôs inner pressures are too chaotic or inconsistent to abstract over concretely. But if through meditation or substances or other methods you symmetrify and generalize those pressures in a positive valence way start to see positive value in buddha vector that eighter does not get attracted to anything but itself or is from a third point of view is looking over any attarctors that te mind converges in and optimizes the mind in such a way that it directs it mostly to attractors connected to positive valence and need for belonging through interconnectedness and unity, you can see this relativity of every possible world model in a nonnihhilistic way, in happy optimistic way, and generate motivation by making part of your meaning of life spreading this positive metamemeplex.

Everyone ever canonized as a saint
Was historically neutral on the topic of Satan
Step three
Avoid hills
Hills are filled with the skeletons of those that died in them
Don't be a skeleton
Don't be anything at all!
If you never stand then you can
Never fall and it's just so
So comfortable
Be agreeable
Step four
When someone says something that you hate
Take a deep breath push it deep down
Turn that frown upside-down and you'll feel great
One quick trick psychologists hate!
Your framework's made of silly putty
You'll let yourself be shaped
An agreea-playdough-ble
Rolled into something that you hate

If you build your metaprocess in such a way that you hate nothing, but everything has nonzero positive valence aspect to it when summed up itself, then hatred always gets canceled by this stronger process in the brain. 

So
How do you feel now about you?
5/10 or more 2?
Fear of 0 kept you from
The 10/10, a
10/10
But congratulations
Everyone likes you again!
But you're neutral on the topic of you, cause
No one will ever love you
No one will ever hate you

Or you can transpose this in such a way that everyone will always love and hate you, but hating itself can be considered as a negative valence form of love, therefore everyone is just falling in love with you in different forms. But its better to just optimize the love itself and connect every phenomena in the world to positive valence expression of love to your and our eternal self. Goal is to find this experience in yoruself and as many others as possible that want to. The more one wants the easier it is for the other one, so trying in those people is the most cost effective from effective altruist optimization point of view. 

Till you're at the pearly gates
But heaven's too good for you
But you're not even bad enough for hell
So purgatory's where you'll dwell
Because you were agreeable

Redirectness to heaven realms works. This text feels more negative than neutral. Pure neutrality would in my opinion be my text without the positive valence parts. It‚Äôs really unstable because it converges into no basic needs being met, so one has to constantly balance stuff if he wants pure neutrality of mind in practice. This is for the subjective heaven/hell realms connected to the valence of self experience. Christian objective realms are structured in such a way that they dont care if you had negative valence experience of mind, only your output matters, in there, mine nad this song‚Äôs structure would be both forms of pure neutrality, if you didnt subsribe on motivating yourself to making other‚Äôs experiences also positive valence ones, yeah. Also, purgatory sounds like a neverending trip. :D

'''ab. Theory and models based on empirical data

'''abc. Ontology

What exists fundamentally? Somethings somehow interacting with other somethings forming more complex somethings. Different paradigms and scientific theories can postulate different structures. Is nonalive physics fundamental? Or consciousness? Or combination of those? Or something third? Or all of them? I'm gonna use the current mostly used paradigms in which most of the scientific models and research about wellbeing that I am interested in is done. 

'''abc. General scientific framework: Universal Harmonic Darwinistic Bayesianism'''

In the framework that I'm using, fundamentally there are fields of matter forming particles that interact with eachother by interaction fields such as the electromagnetic field with photons.
More formally particles are quantum excitation of fermion fields and the interaction is mediated by a gauge field.

These interacting particles then form atoms. Atoms form molecules. Cells are made up of molecules such as nucleic acids, carbohydrates or lipids, and also macromolecules proteins that are made of molecules aminoacids. Cells together form clusters of neurons that can encode mental representations. You can locate whole brain regions that are optimized for specific functions. You can locate inner parts in internal family systems theraphy. You can locate hiearchical abstractions of mental representations in the prefortal cortrex. You can locate slower higher order more conscious conceptual mind influecing the more subconscious faster intuitive mind. Next you get whole organs, whole animals, you can study species with their cultures, that are on earth in the solar system in a galaxy in clusters of galaxies and so on up to infinity through emergence! Consciousness is the physical brain activity that causally edits the experience. But also the models of physics is constructed in our generative models, its a very useful tool for predicting our sensory data and engineering new technology.

Different natural science fields and models in them are different lenses specializing in studying different components at different scales predicting different things in different domains using different tools and are differently succesful. These fields have many mathematical methodological correspondences between them which is identifable by languages that apply in more contexts at once, which is the essence of mathematics. Each scale can be predicted by modelling it computationally by in time evolving statespace with initial conditions.

You can study any of those parts and their interactions predict the evolution in time on any scale in any context using the language of the different scientific fields, or you can use this universal complexity science language governed by the free energy principle that unifies fields such as physics, biology, neuroscience, psychology, computer science, artificial intelligence, evolutionary theory and statistics by describing complex adaptive systems of all scales in terms of energy and information flows using dynamical systems and chaos theory, statistical nonequilibrium thermodynamics, information theory, cybernetics, group theory and harmonic analysis (From the physics lens, everything is a harmonic oscillator!).

[[File:TOE.jpg|500px|Alt text]]

How to understand all of this? It starts with the world being as a stochastic differential equation, which means that all things - particles to people to the largest systems all move or evolve according to two processes, which combine. First is smooth flowing evolution such as planets orbiting a star or waves rippling over water or though quantum fields. Second is a random process that knocks around the smooth flow in unpredictable ways such as twinkling stars or audio static. These two processes are kind of an order and chaos - yin and yang - forever intertwined and meshed. These two very different effects combine into a chaotic flow which may be entangled in a kind of tropical storm while still maintaing resemblence of structure and things such as raindrops undulating back to earth in a state of constant flux yet still droplets, or a human being growing and adapting to the surprises of life while still remaining individual physical entity. What must things do in order to exist? Better question is: If things exist, what must they do? From the foundation of stochastic differential equations, things, defined as hiearchical markov blankets, must always move towards a pullback attractor, which is a special set of attracting states which maintains the integrity of the markov blanket and therefore a thing's coherence and identity over time. One of the profound consequences of this is that the dynamics of such a system, its laws of motion - principle of least action, will manifest a form of flow dynamics, that can be interpreted as bayesian active inference. In another words such a thing maintains an internal equivalent of a generative model encoding beliefs about the world and itself, minimizing its complexity and maximizing its accuracy. The thing adaptively learns using what it sees and thinks and acts to increase evolutionary fitness by reducing stress and dissonance. People succesfuly predicting their senses, visual data and objects, life, doing better than expected, succesfuly solving basic needs, selfrealizing and growing will be fit, satisfied and healthy with all other parts in the body hyperorganism of communicating cells sending positive signals. An example of a pullback attractor is day and night cycle, seasons or rituals. The thing uses the model to decide actions and performs a bayesian belief update based on the outcomes driven by simple laws of motion, dynamically maintaining the boundaries between things, maintaining order in the face of chaos. Biological systems harvest negentropy and build structure, build internal coherence between internal parts and the environment, to resist entropy - the second law of thermodynamics. Animals eat, think, stay unified and cooperating, internally and externally, physiologically and psychologically, to not die. When an open system gets pushed far from equilibrium by a flow of energy it will naturally selforganize. Psychedelic substances might lead to bigger harmony in the biochemical electromagnetical dynamics between different neuronal populations, making parts of experience feel more consonant and relaxed, more smoothly and regularly shaped. Newton's laws of motion, Einstein equations and Feynman path integral follow from the principle of least action. Free Energy Principle is principle of least action applied to a markov blanket. In machine learning free energy corresponds to evidence lower bound. All of this is applicable across all scales and time leading to an ecosystem of things interacting across scales. 

Loop quantum gravity by Lee Smolin and Carlo Rovelli is my favorite candidate for a theory of everything.

Solving the background independence of general relativity vs background dependence of quantum mechanics clash by quantizing and independencing space  with abstractifying away by representing the space of metrics (general relativity warped spacetime configurations) in the default unsolvable Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation that describes the quantum fuziness evolution of the geometry of space into solvable equation of evolving space of connections, where connections are functions telling how something like a vector's rotation changes in euclidian space as it moves between two points in a for example hyperbolic space and the rotation encodes the hyperbolicity, which is by default messy rewrite, so instead of vectors one can use spinors, a vectorlike thing that also represents quantum of angular momentum or spin aka Ashketar's variables, where space of metrics looks like a space of fields in quantum field theory. Ashketar's spin connections, but also evaluated over closed loops, are in the loop quantum gravity. Closed loops means that each quantized point in the fuzzily quantum evolving geometry of space connects back to itself, quantum circuits of gravitational field. 3D space can be sort of woven from these loops into a spin-network - pixelated on small scales, looking like space on large scales, irreducible grains of space connected by quantized are faces like facets. Nodes that intersect the loops = quanta of space. Loops between the nodes = 2D areas. Large quantities of these loops = spin network. Space = geometry of spin network. Time = movement of the spin network. Quantized planck space, and time = ticking like a digital clock. Spin network + time = spin foam. Added mass and energy disort the spin network diisort the shape of the volumes of the spin network is disorted, this distorts space and time, because any movement of these quanta disorts the time quanta. Time is movement of the volume quanta. This distortion of space and time is gravity.

It predicts Hawking radiation and black hole entropy consistent with Hawking and Bekenstein's equations. It gives variable speed of light depending on the energy of the photon, slightly faster gamma rays than radio waves due to the grainyness of loop quantum gravity spacetime. No infinities: Big bang didnt start with a singularity, infinitely dense and infinitely small, because of limit of planck space size. Maximum energy density when reached repels additional energy. The universe started with big bounce - the universe was big at one time, then contracted, it bounced, and then exploded from this bounce. Eternalism.

Not as lost in the combinatorial explosion of abstractness as string theory.

Combine with relational interpretation of quantum mechanics!

But it has its issues, it deosnt solve the problem of time in the questions of the general relativity on large nonquantum scales in the classical limit, or what is dark energy and matter, but that might be resolved with more research. 

Maybe an absolutely predictive model of what spacetime with contents emerges from goes beyond human symbolic and shapeshifting imagination. 

trying to conceptually grasp and predict some measured forces of some measured shapes across all scales
rethinking how flow of electrons heats up light bulb or creates insane complexity of dynamics in tranzistors that we arreanged to have predictive behavior that we want from which we see things on screens that make sense to us in and communicate across insane distances kind of blows my mind 
the notion that neurons passing electrochemical signals through neurotransmitters and ions and selforganizing by electric fields learning to respond to messages from their environment as a markov blanket or reinforcement learning agent by modelling it and storing templates probably in soma's RNA and a turning machine which somehow encodes our generative model as colletive work of catching billions of correlations from bilion modalities (senses concepts space time others qualia) with our environment is totally mindblowing
all of that somehow as a metastable pattern of tons of interacting elementary probabilistically fuzzy wavey evolving particles of matter through electromagnetism in spin foam not immideatly dissolving into entropy thanks to most systems going towards disorder 
what if right after big bounce there was dawinian competition of all possible types of particles as waves in a spin foam with variable properies beyond the ones we observe right now that eventually many were selected out and the ones we have right now are the only ones that are stable under current conditions

"Depiction of the human brain in terms of entailed aspects of experience (i.e., phenomenology), as well as computational (or functional), algorithmic, and implementational levels of analysis. A phenomenological level is specified to provide mappings between consciousness and these complementary/supervenient levels of analysis. Modal depictions connotate the radically embodied nature of mind, but not all images are meant to indicate conscious experiences. Phenomenal consciousness may solely be generated by hierarchies centered on posterior medial cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and angular gyrus as respective visuospatial (cf. consciousness as projective geometric modeling), somatic (cf. grounded cognition and intermediate level theory), and intentional/attentional phenomenology (cf. Attention Schema Theory). Computationally, various brain functions are identified according to particular modal aspects, either with respect to generating perception (both unconscious and conscious) or action (both unconscious and potentially conscious, via posterior generative models). [Note: Action selection can also occur via affordance competition in posterior cortices, and frontal generative models could be interpreted as a kind of forward-looking (unconscious) perception, made conscious as imaginings via parameterizing the inversion of posterior generative models.] On the algorithmic level, these functions are mapped onto variants of machine learning architectures‚Äîe.g., autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, graph neural networks (GNNs), recurrent reservoirs and liquid state machines‚Äîorganized according to potential realization by neural systems. GNN-structured latent spaces are suggested as a potentially important architectural principle, largely due to efficiency for emulating physical processes. Hexagonally-organized grid graph GNNs are depicted in posterior medial cortices as contributing to quasi-Cartesian spatial modeling (and potentially experience), as well as in dorsomedial, and ventromedial prefrontal cortices for agentic control. Neuroimaging evidence suggests these grids may be dynamically coupled in various ways, contributing to higher-order cognition as a kind of navigation/search process through generalized space. A further GNN is speculatively adduced to reside in supramarginal gyrus as a mesh grid placed on top of a transformed representation of the primary sensorimotor homunculus (cf. body image/schema for the sake of efficient motor control/inference). This quasi-homuncular GNN may have some scaled correspondence to embodiment as felt from within, potentially morphed/re-represented to better correspond with externally viewed embodiments (potentially both resulting from and enabling ‚Äúmirroring‚Äù with other agents for coordination and inference). Speculatively, this partial translation into a quasi-Cartesian reference frame may provide more effective couplings (or information-sharing) with semi-topographically organized representations in posterior medial cortices. Angular gyrus is depicted as containing a ring-shaped GNN to reflect a further level of abstraction and hierarchical control over action-oriented body schemas‚Äîwhich may potentially mediate coherent functional couplings between the ‚Äúlived body‚Äù and the ‚Äúmind‚Äôs eye‚Äù‚Äîfunctionally entailing vectors/tensors over attentional (and potentially intentional) processes. [Note: The language of predictive processing provides bridges between implementational and computational (and also phenomenological) levels, but descriptions such as vector fields and attracting manifolds could have alternatively been used to remain agnostic as to which implicit algorithms might be entailed by physical dynamics.] On the implementational level, biological realizations of algorithmic processes are depicted as corresponding to flows of activity and interactions between neuronal populations, canalized by the formation of metastable synchronous complexes (i.e., ‚Äúself-organizing harmonic modes‚Äù)."

'''abcd. Brain networks/regions models of mental phenomena'''

This approach studies how connectivity topology inside and between various brain regions relate to mental phenomena such as wellbeing and mental discomfort. 

'''abcd. Active Inference using Free Energy Principle'''

Active Inference is special case of the Free Energy Principle applied to the brain, where brain does approximate bayesian inference. The basic idea is that our brains are the game of predicting sensory inputs to try and unfer the causes that generate sensations and to work out states of the world so that we can respond adaptively. We're predicting our ability to interact with the world in optionally gripping fashion using what we've learned. If we saw the raw physics and the extreme complexity of everything instead we would go crazy. If we predict that the world is positive, it will be positive. If we truly believe that in front of us is a pink unicorn when taking a psychedelic substance, it will be there in our experience, even tho other people won't see it because of different set of beliefs. 

The most mathematically optimal way to work with information is the bayes theorem and our brains seem work work in bayesian mathematics. The issue is that the bayesian theorem is too costly to compute on its own as there is a combinatorial explosion of possibilites. Evolution sidesteps this by creating an internal dynamical generative model that is active and is being edited depending on the error between predicted sensory data, our priors, and actual measured sensory data. <ref>[[Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality - YouTube]([Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality - YouTube]([Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality - YouTube]([Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality - YouTube]([Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality - YouTube]([Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw5Q5h8s6FI)))))) Bayesian Brain and the Ultimate Nature of Reality]</ref>

What we see is what we expect to see.

We're never actually predicting the world per se, we're predicting our ability to interact with the world in optionally gripping fashion using what we've learned.

We can be seen as a stack of biologically hardwired and learned homeostats.

Biological systems resist the second law of thermodynamics - entropy aka chaos, by harvesting negentropy from our environment. This harvesting of negentropy is realized as eating food, harvesting solar energy and building models that predict the world. Without reducing uncertainity by building models about the world, we wouldn't be certain where to get food and in more modern age power our system with electricity.

From this seems to follow that the only thing we can be sure about is how predictive our mental or mathematical models are in their domain.

And some of those mental models in certain mental frameworks are more pleasant to inhabit or are generating more motivation and sense of meaning, or include more positive biases, unconditional love, or cognitive traps, than others.

Communication between neurons that create brain tissue is orchestrated by the electromagnetic field, usually called bioelectricity. Studying this can tell us a lot about experience and edit it by locating neural correlates. Neurons store adaptively learned templates and beliefs of processing their sensory data in their RNA that they exchange between eachother. All cells can be seen as reinforcement learning agents, but neurons are special in a way that they can communicate among long distances like a telegraph. With bioelectric activity, the beliefs construct the generative model by predicting future sensory data after compressing present ones using visual modality, auditory modality, other senses - energy body, touch, feelings, thoughts,... Beliefs in the neurophenomenological software, where some of it is conscious (global workspace), correspond to shapes in the electromagnetic field. You can do harmonic analysis or use group theory.

'''abcd. Neural Annealing

Annealing is important concept for meditation, psychedelics, belief updates and so on.
General structure of annealing is accumulation of internal free energy in a system leading to increased temperature which reduces constraints on freedom of action for the elements of the system leading to elements exploiting new freedom and naturally selforganizing into (usually) more consonant / symmetrical configuration. In psychedelics and meditation, free energy is semantically neutral free computational power and elements are neurons.

(brain activity not correlated with consciousness interlocking with activity correlated with consciousness) 

When the ground of the ocean moves, it creates waves aka thoughts. (neurons firing and creating electrochemical/magnetic/potentials activity) When one part of the ground moves, the neighboring parts start to move too, lighting up associations. (associative/symmetry-based representations in the hippocampus<ref>[[Place cells: How your brain creates maps of abstract spaces - YouTube](https://youtu.be/iV-EMA5g288) Place cells: How your brain creates maps of abstract spaces]</ref>) Soft rain or hurricane can affect waves or the whole ocean and that shapes the ground, like friend telling you he had a good day or him causing you trauma. (measuring sensory data and learning patterns from them. ([[Predictive Coding]], [[Active Inference]]) The ground overtime forms new interesting shapes, which is like learning knowledge, some shapes being worse or better at creating groups of smaller (thinking about cars) or longer waves (thinking about meaning of life), with less and more flow. (statespace of [[neural representations]], [[Memeplex - Qualia Research](https://qualiaresearch.miraheze.org/wiki/Memeplex) memeplexes]) 

The ground gets used and cracks or deformations in shape can happen, which blocks certain parts of the ground affecting other parts, which results in less flow of waves and stress, dissonance. ([[Symmetry Theory of Valence]]) This can be fixed by long smooth waves, like relaxation (raising semantically neutral free energy parameter<ref>[Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net]([Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net]([Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net]([Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net]([Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net]([Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net]([Neural Annealing: Toward a Neural Theory of Everything ‚Äì Opentheory.net](https://opentheory.net/2019/11/neural-annealing-toward-a-neural-theory-of-everything/)))))))</ref>), which smoothens the ground, allowing flow again. ([[Neural Annealing]]) One part of the ground is the identity, primal instincts, and quick, impulsive behavior (default mode network), that likes small waves, other part of the ground corresponds to selfcontrol, slow, planned behavior (central executive network), that likes long waves, and they are communicating between each other.<ref>[https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2022/1/niac013/6758320 Beyond the veil of duality‚Äîtopographic reorganization model of meditation]</ref> The stronger one can take too much control sometimes, creating too much (ruminating, addictions, thinking too concretely) or not enough small waves or too much (thinking too generally) or not enough (absence of emotions) long waves. 

The smoother the waves aka thoughts, the more pleasant they are, the more they smoothen the ground. The bigger, the more intense they are. The longer, the more interconnected with everything else they are. Smooth big long waves are the waves of biggest happiness, which is created by for example deconstructive [[meditation]]<ref>[https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo4455#.Y0cxJJgZqB8.twitter Mindfulness-induced endogenous theta stimulation occasions self-transcendence and inhibits addictive behavior]</ref> or [[5-MeO-DMT]], in general intense positive emotional experiences.

"To use a musical metaphor, in experiences of pain and unfulfilled desire, the overall melody is played in a more minor, or entropic key/timbre. Alternatively, in experiences of pleasure and fulfilled desire‚Äîpotentially including virtual fulfillment (i.e., pleasurable anticipation)‚Äîaffective orchestras play melodies with greater consonance. One could view such soundtracks to the (fully immersive virtual reality) movies of experience as separate streams of information that help contextualize what is being seen on ‚Äòscreens‚Äô over which we see stories unfold. However, it may be closer to experience to say that this metaphorical music enters into what we see and feel, imbuing (or synesthetically coloring) it with meanings. Indeed, we may be able to find most of the principles of affective phenomena to be well-reflected in our experiences of music, where we play with building and releasing tension, enjoying the rise and fall of more and less consonant (or less and more dissonant) melodies. In musical pleasure, we explore harmony and the contrast of disharmony, eventually expecting to return home to the wholeness of the tonic, but with abilities of our ‚Äúexperiencing selves‚Äù to find satisfaction in the moment not necessarily being the reasons that our ‚Äúremembering selves‚Äù find ourselves attracted to particular songs.

The affective melodies played by neural orchestras will be dominated by interoceptive modalities, the most ancient‚Äîboth developmentally and evolutionarily speaking‚Äîand reliable indicators of homeostatic and reproductive potential. Do we have relaxed and dynamic cardiac rhythms? Is our breathing easy or forced? Do we feel warm‚Äîbut not too hot‚Äîor cold? Are our bowels irritated or copacetic? Do we feel full or empty inside? Do we feel like our body is whole and strong, ours to command where we will, if we wanted it? Or do we feel damaged and weak? This interoceptive information speaks to foundations of life and the cores of value out of which persons may grow." "Much of the phenomenology of desire may represent the prediction of value-attainment, activating associated somatic and interoceptive concomitants of consummation, which are subjectively (and synesthetically) felt in body maps in places most associated with value realization. If these sensations are accompanied by temporary net decreases in predicting homeostatic or reproductive value-realization‚Äîpotentially mediated by opioid signaling‚Äîoverall unpleasant interoceptive inference may accompany these perceptions. In this way, the feeling of desire would be experienced as a kind of pain, with its particular characteristics depending on unique learning histories. However, painful desire can be transformed into pleasurable anticipation if we find ourselves predicting overall increases in value, so creating pleasurable contrasts with the discomfort of wanting. If the visceral concomitants of affective experiences become entangled with exteroceptive and proprioceptive percepts in the quasi-synesthetic fashion described above, then pleasure and pain (including desire) would be generated as interoceptive modes becoming infused into other modalities in particular ways based on historical associations." <ref>[[Entropy | Free Full-Text | The Radically Embodied Conscious Cybernetic Bayesian Brain: From Free Energy to Free Will and Back Again]([Entropy | Free Full-Text | The Radically Embodied Conscious Cybernetic Bayesian Brain: From Free Energy to Free Will and Back Again]([Entropy | Free Full-Text | The Radically Embodied Conscious Cybernetic Bayesian Brain: From Free Energy to Free Will and Back Again]([Entropy | Free Full-Text | The Radically Embodied Conscious Cybernetic Bayesian Brain: From Free Energy to Free Will and Back Again]([Entropy | Free Full-Text | The Radically Embodied Conscious Cybernetic Bayesian Brain: From Free Energy to Free Will and Back Again](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/6/783))/htm))) The Radically Embodied Conscious Cybernetic Bayesian Brain by Adam Safron]</ref> <ref>[[Frontiers | An Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) of Consciousness: Combining Integrated Information and Global Neuronal Workspace Theories With the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework; Toward Solving the Hard Problem and Characterizing Agentic Causation]([Frontiers | An Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) of Consciousness: Combining Integrated Information and Global Neuronal Workspace Theories With the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework; Toward Solving the Hard Problem and Characterizing Agentic Causation]([Frontiers | An Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) of Consciousness: Combining Integrated Information and Global Neuronal Workspace Theories With the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework; Toward Solving the Hard Problem and Characterizing Agentic Causation]([Frontiers | An Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) of Consciousness: Combining Integrated Information and Global Neuronal Workspace Theories With the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework; Toward Solving the Hard Problem and Characterizing Agentic Causation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2020.00030/full)))) An Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) of Consciousness: Combining Integrated Information and Global Neuronal Workspace Theories With the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework; Toward Solving the Hard Problem and Characterizing Agentic Causation by Adam Safron]</ref>

Evolution shapes what default evolutionary biologically hardwired set of beliefs emerge that we can be doing better than expected at and what structures are capable having latent property of amount of symmetries and asymmetries (Maslow Hiearchy of Needs, Josha Bach's Engine of Motivation)

Deconstructive meditation, psychedelics and nondual (boundaryless, expansive, general) thinking symmetrify (smoothen) the shape of our generative model by dissolving the cortical hiearchy of beliefs (philosophical assumptions, interacting self and environment model, predictions about existence or properties of units located in spacetime data structure using the language of causality), resulting in freeing the brain dynamics' flow of energy from the self model attractor default mode network. Constructive family of practices implement pleasant (symmetrical, interconnecting, consonant with the rest) or unpleasant beliefs about us, others or the world.

The epistemic agent center corresponds to the default mode network, which gets weakened on meditation (more on that later), on meditation, you can repeatedly dissolve the great attractor/contraction of iamness/existence by endlessly looking for it and what it's made of without using concepts and constantly not finding it. Self model gets less weight and therefore the organism creates less stress to keep it. Ego dissolution is the weakening of this self center of experience, which can be temporary or permanent.

'''abcd. Meditation'''

'''abcdef. All'''

Meditation can be the most generally defined selfmetaprogramming of our generative model contents or shape. This can really be extended to psychedelics or just normal everyday life. Deconstructive meditation is systematic asymmetry, contraction, dissonance, viscosity, stress, blockage,... reduction. Nondual enlightenment is replacing the deepest priors in our cortical hiearchy, that function as initial predictions in constructing our generative model, with nondual priors, allowing a stable selfreinforcing persistent symmetrical state.

The difference between everyday life and formal undisturbed meditation is that you have much better conditions to more efficiently carefully inspect, dissolve, strenghten, or edit insides of your inner generative model and make it smoother to allow more flow, more pleasant symmetrical dynamics. Meditation makes transparent processes that construct our reality opaque, letting us replace the deepest priors about reality. Nondual enlightenment is replacement of fundamental belief priors with nondual beliefs. Slow disintegration of cortical hiearchy of concepts. Nondual awareness can be conceptualualized as the substrate on which the generative model arises, but even that can be dissolved and doesn't need to be reified. Psychedelics do this in extreme way and are harder to control. There is a learnable skill of learning to be in a flow state by making your genertive's model topology such that one is satisfied with every moment and no thoughts that want to change what is emerge.

Shifts in permanent experience (for example nondual enlightenment or dark night of the soul) on meditation are the result of a permanent (not just an experience that fades away after the meditation session) reorganization of neural networks into a different configuration (a phase shift in the configuration space). Jhanas or overall mediation can induce it by repetition. Some people can get enlightened after a single psychedelic trip or out of nowhere, some people need to meditate or trip for years for a permanent shift in experience to happen, what matters is the stbility of the configuration. The more entropic, closer to criticality, near phase shift, it is, the easier it is to prmanently change one's own perception, as the statistical hull of the current configuration is weaker, and less conflicting data is needed to induce a generative model update.

'''abcde. BN'''

Weakening default mode network, strenghtening central executive network and its connections with DMN.
In this sense, meditation can be seen analogous to fitness. You are literally making the muscles of your brain stronger.

'''abcde. NA'''

In do nothing meditation, neural annealing increases the free energy parameter in the brain, leading to entropic disintegration (dissolution) of existing structures and reselforganization into a more symmetrical configuration. You can also dissolve, strenghten or transform existing structures corrresponding to belifs, or get high level connections between concepts to emerge. The whole topology gets smoother. Compared to psychedelics, one has more control over it, its much less extreme. 

'''abcde. Emptiness as mental constructedness'''

Emptiness is a core concept in deconstructive meditation. It means that everything is just a nebulous dream-like rainbow-like mental construction. Everything is surrounded by spaciousness. There's no source, destination, concepts. But there also is. Groundless ground. Emptiness is empty too. If you think you understand emptiness then you don't understand emptiness. Total mystery, grasping the unknowable.

'''abcdef. FEP'''

Everything that used to be transparent becomes opaque, you get metawareness of the generators of your experience. What was holding together the self model and its distinction with object is seen though and deconstructed. It is there but not there. This realization reduces suffering a lot.

'''abcd. Total mental frameworks and identities: philosophies, ontologies, ideologies, religions,...'''

'''abcde. FEP'''

Each total mental framework is one of many attempts at maximally reducing the uncertainity in sensory data. It generates an explanation (usually deterministic and linear story) for any measured pattern.

'''abcde. All'''

Using this style of conceptualization, everyone constructs his own reality according to what environment with what memeplexes he grew up in and what his nervous system is inclined to be attracted towards, which is determined by the genetic code and what embodied in environment evolution it went though.

Mental framework can be seen as axiomatic (fundamentalist) metavectors fueling (or parasiting) all experience, ultimate uncertainity entropy reduction, generating flow in one single direction. Destabilizing them (structures of ego aka self model in general) by measuring conflicting data hurts and defence mechanisms arise as it generates negative valence. 

'''abcde. Groundless ground'''

Identity shift to groundless ground is very useful as it minimizes fear or not feeling home when dissolving the generative model's evolutionary useful structures to feel more free. The less you fundamentally identify with some concrete cluster of sensations, the less things will bother you. Mental frameworks are configurations of the qualia that make the new insights stick. Groundless ground makes all nondual dissolving realizations stick permanently, makin them not just an experience that instantly fades away. The more one pushes himself in this framework, the more it stick. Constantly integrating emptiness into form. Mundane things become divine. Being "out of simulation" becomes the same as being "trapped inside simulation". Nirvana becomes samsara. Duality becomes nonduality. Distinction becomes unity. Somewhat something moving on a fading road. Experience without projector. The screen of consciousness isn't fundamental too. No ground. Freedom.

'''abcdef. All'''

Groundless ground is the "ultimate" underfitting mental framework, symmetrifying all asymmetries in the symbolic mind's topology.

'''abcd. Substances'''

Substances alter your usual brain wave dynamics.<ref>[[Qualia Research Institute](https://qri.org/)blog/nonlinear-wave-computing Nonlinear Wave Computing: Vibes, Gestalts, and Realms]</ref>

<references/> 

'''abcde. Stimulants'''

Stimulants, or dopamine, direct the flow of experience more as concrete local motivation is increased. Local actions are more meaningful and more easily solvable with less distractions being generated. 

'''abcde. Dissociatives'''

Dissociatives just turn off all processes in your generative model. K-hole is blinking out of existence.

'''abcde. Alcohol'''

Alcohol is great social lubricant. 
it in similar ways like psychedelics deconstructs your usual thinking patterns and you speak more from your core with less filters. Plus its euphoric. It can turn your whole mind off. You can loose your evolutionary useful learned boundaries. The downside is the potential health issues and hangover that follows.

'''abcde. Weed'''

Weed nicely relaxes the thinking mind, creates random connections, enhances creativity.

'''abcde. Antidepressives'''

The serotonin hypothesis of depression has been empirically debunked. If it was true, SSRIs would function immideatly. The most plausible model of antidepressives is that serotonin adds noise to the brain (psychedelics too in slightly different way), creating random connections, which enhances neuroplasticity: the ability of the brain networks to more easily reorganize to a different configuration - to a less depressive/anxious etc. one in a way I described earlier. This is why it works differently for different people and why its more effective in conjunction with psychotheraphy and overall changes of external conditions, which pushes the system to that different configuration.

'''abcde. Psychedelics'''

Psychedelics can be seen as an internal enhancers of what's already there. Can make you see absolute meaning in everything and contemplate deeply in a raw unfiltered fashion. You can loose your evolutionary useful learned boundaries too. Psychedelic afterglow can be amazing.

'''abcdef. CHEMTSCH'''

Neural annealing says that with psychedelics, the free energy parameter in the brain is massively increased, leading to massive entropic disintegration (dissolution) of existing structures and reselforganization into a more symmetrical configuration. Dissolution is mostly common with 5-MeO-DMT. Existing structures can be dissolved, strenghtened or transformed. Other psychedelics also dissolve, but much more strenchten or transform existing belief structures. Many new interconnections between them can happen. If the trip revolves around a dissonant structure such as some worry, that can get strongly stenghtened and interconnected with everything, resulting in trauma. 

'''abcd. DMT entities and Gods'''

DMT entities and Gods are higher order selfsynchronizing superselfmetaprogramming agent metaprocesss, usually outside of self model's agency, editable indirectly, you can merge with them, such as with god of compassion on meditation, or the God of Everything on 5-MeO-DMT as global coherence of clusters of brain dynamics, dissolving internal boundaries. DMT entities can be seen as competing clusters of coherence.

DMT entities and Gods are standard background noise of self stabilizing software agents that normally parasitize on organismic information processing networks but get amplified when you blow yourself out of your brain on psychedelics. 

Gods are metaphors for nonsymbolic aka intuitionbased aka Fristonian free energetic force or attractors in the neurophenomenological statespace.

They are usually some extreme of the psyche,: freedom, unity, suffering. Or symbolisms for something: fertility, sea, underworld, art.

DMT entities can be projections of sociodynamic landscapes. For example, Jesters/Clowns/Harlequins express "narcissistic vibrational modes" of consciousness. Their traps & childish playpen energy is a manifestation of conditional love.

Bodhisattva energy, on the other hand, is a manifestation of unconditional love modes of consciousness. It's such a different kind of vibrational landscape!

DMT can help you see what kind of social dynamics you are subconsciously modeling as your "default mode of interaction". <ref>[https://twitter.com/algekalipso/status/1602578160943599617 Andr√©s G√≥mez Emilsson tweet]</ref>

DMT activates a notion of observing foundational agency, while dissociating the individual self. Fractalized agency = machine elves, Gaia-ized agency = Pascha Mama, unified agency = cosmic consciousness, contracted unified agency = cosmic core <ref>[https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1364675761781628928 Joscha Bach tweet]</ref>

With classic psychedelics, which stand somewhere between DMT and 5-MeO-DMT in their level of global coherence, you always go through an annealing process before finally ‚Äúsnapping‚Äù into global coherence and ‚Äúbecoming one with God‚Äù. That coherence is the signature of these mystical experiences becomes rather self-evident once you pay attention to annealing signatures (i.e. noticing how incompatible metronomes slowly start synchronizing and forming larger and larger structures until one megastructure swallows it all and dissolves the self-other boundary in the process of doing so).<ref>[[On Rhythms of the Brain: Jhanas, Local Field Potentials, and Electromagnetic Theories of Consciousness | Qualia  Computing]([On Rhythms of the Brain: Jhanas, Local Field Potentials, and Electromagnetic Theories of Consciousness | Qualia  Computing]([On Rhythms of the Brain: Jhanas, Local Field Potentials, and Electromagnetic Theories of Consciousness | Qualia  Computing]([On Rhythms of the Brain: Jhanas, Local Field Potentials, and Electromagnetic Theories of Consciousness | Qualia  Computing](https://qualiacomputing.com/2022/10/27/on-rhythms-of-the-brain-jhanas-local-field-potentials-and-electromagnetic-theories-of-consciousness/)))) On Rhythms of the Brain: Jhanas, Local Field Potentials, and Electromagnetic Theories of Consciousness]</ref>

God, or ontology and morals in general, as this ultimate abstraction on the highest level that controls everything else in the lower levels in some ways, and top down processing! 

Higher abstractions are bending the spacetime of lower abstractions in a cortical hiearchy!

'''abcd. Meaning'''

What is the most meaningful thing that has ever happened to you? Or what is the most meaningful situation to you? Something profound, transformative, intensely lived through, full of life and your values being satisfied? Full of selfactualization, selfrealization?

Meaning can be seen as the sense of connection with us, others and everything.

Meaning is also the set of values that we have. Values are fundamental priors and process niches that the nervous system experiences biggest amount of flow in. (influenced by both nature (genes) and nurture (environmental influences))

Connection with us is created by working on us, analyzing us, training to love us, inner spiritual work. 

Connection with others is created by community that resonates with us culturally (philosophy, ideology,...), couple of clouse friends and significiant other we resonate with across as many scales as possible in psychology, not just physical attraction.

Connection with the universe and everything is the sense of being part of something greater, something transcendental. Paradigm of emergence or god consciousness. Siblings in the wound of creation on groundless ground, interconnected beyond space and time. Cultivating flow, harmony with what is in the present moment.

'''abcde. Definition of mental disorder'''

It's a disorder if it disallows the individual to feel happiness and achieve his values and goals in which he sees meaning.

The least damaged brain in my lens is one that enables the most wellbeing while still being functional in everyday tasks.
So short term "derails" from the usual metastable configuration are part of the process.

I see all those mental divergences from norm as spectrummy clusters of patterns in behavior caused genetically and environmentally that can create both adaptive or maladaptive patterns in behavior or neurobiology producing more than avarage suffering or happiness depending on the patterns. It can have evolutionary functions (such as being tribe leader, engineer, healer,...) to which one can adapt if the environment supports it with conditions, but it also can make one desynchronize with the environment or in general with himself internally, creating suffering for the individual, and neurotheraphypharmatechnological methods or any behavior correlating with happiness empirically can change the neurobiology to make the individual fit in his environment more or help his neurobiology have dynamics that supports having hedonium in the first place, making him suffer less. On the other hand in some cases some proposed methods can contract him into social constructs and happiness conditionings which can kill his ability to see freeying emptiness and feel unconditional love.

Different systems also maximize different things with different intensities with different philosophical and political systems, which can be framed by minimizing dissonance under current memeplexes with least action. Happiness , knowledge, agency, productivity, technology, predictivity,  spirituality or equality of beings for example, after basic needs of people are met (not always haha), which determines what should be normal by social constructs,...

Different cultures have different set of normal behaviors and therefore different definitions of mental divergences that dont make the individual fit into the environment which then tries to fix him to fit into the environment. Avarage modernist american/european city or academia where psychosis is seeing empirically unmeasurable stuff (which sometimes breaks down haha) versus buddhist monk centers where its weird to not be dissolved versus spiritual groups where experiencing minds to the fullest isnt weird versus hyperfundamentalist muslim or christian countries where not believing in god is sign of devil that needs to be fixed with with neurotheraphypharmatechnological intervention. I'm an individual that loves to play with his internal models in the sea of atheistic Czechia, which isnt very compatible with most people here lol, but i can find compatible people where anyway. But I'm glad we don't tryhard capitalism as hard as America.

A lot of the pharmacological solutions also solve symptoms instead of the cause. In this book I'm advocating for going at the cause.

The very process that makes us effectively adapt to the environment by selecting relevant information in sensory data and constructing relevant for survival and collective goals useful hypotheses/models about them makes us vulnerable to selfdestructive dukkha suffering spirals. ADHD, causing the individual to jump from one thing to other on his mind, having trouble finishing stuff, forgetting stuff, impulsivity, which can create suffering by sense of failure, brokeness etc. generating negative experiental traumatic memories and associations, or autism making the individual create meaning of life around super specific topic, which makes him not being able to talk to people with normal social constructs. But combined gives the ability to do asperger like hyperfocus on topics that are extremely meaningful for the individual, which can on the other hand create meaningful life, status, sense of freedom,... It has to be compatible with the environment tho, to sustain the individual with the collective. To reduce individual's sense of uncertainity of his basic needs and meaning of life being fullfilled,... it can be adaptive or maladaptive. Stress is mostly not good neurobiologically for hedonium belief networks with consonant activity and functioning biohardware that isnt collapsing even tho it can enhance concrete productivity. You also dont want configurations that permanently break down some needed brain's functions such as for example consistent inner world simulation or ability to model somewhat coherent stories to make you survive with the environment, vibe with others, or not getting sucked into bad wellbeing attractor. Context matters!

To free mind from hindrances (sensual desire not aligned with current context, anger, hostility, hatred, sloth, restlessness, worry, doubt) that can be seen as forces in motor planning space field interfering with flow of energy in the phenomenal field, warping its spacetime like gravity n theory of relativity. Notice the hindrance, objectify it, throw it away or replace it by making it just a nebulous fabrication, optionally deconstruct it or show it proof that it serves no purpose anymore or show it love or show it that it doesn't exist without space and time with no possible linear structure and self other distinction. Come to present moment. Add wholesome thoughts. Warping of this spacetime by desires can be seen as suffering. Not warping this space is a learnable skill through meditation. 

Actions can be motivated and reinforced by fear, pain, pleasure. They are usually fight flight freeze responces. Managers (planning) managing the system to get away from exiles (painful memories) and exiles being shut down by firefighters (substance addictions). The space of needs to change the current state to better one is full of evolutionary useful darwinian delusions that makes us construct goals and make us statebuilding species. "Owning this car will finally make me satisfied!" can generate temporary happiness but usually you climb down back to the hedonic set point, as what material things seems to matter in the long term is just the cost of basic living, and those other material things don't make profound changes to the topology and generative model's structure of one's nervous system, which is where the sense of wellbeing seems to originate. Next step for selfmetaprogramming happiness is cultivating this symmetrical mind in for example this way that I'm describing in this book.

'''abcdef. Building packets of negentropy'''

Concetrate on an object. Anything you like concetrating on, breath, mandala, good things from the day. Smooth flow aka contentless states of high concetraction, sensory clarity, equaminity, love can be seen as packets of consonant negentropy, when sent as messages are melting dissonant knotted traumatic structures/bayesian markov blanket beliefs. 

'''abcdef. Seven factors of awakening'''

"In brief, you first need to use ‚Äúflow‚Äù which ‚Äúmelts‚Äù the structures (knots) of your world-simulation and makes them flexible and amenable to modifications. Then you use the seven factors in order to direct the evolution of the flow into healing and harmonious dynamics. Doing this over and over will, over time, allow you to create a very wholesome and healing flow. More specifically, here are the seven factors as seen through the lens of Neural Annealing:

a. Balancing Factor:

1. Mindfulness

a) Maintain flow in the foreground

b) Focus on the texture rather than the content of flow

c) Monitor for the arising of hindrances and inclining the mind away from them

d) Noticing all the clusters of flow 

b. Energizing Factors:

1. Energy

a) This is what happens when you ‚Äúpluck‚Äù the flow. Naturally, this energizes the eigenmodes of the flow! It is like the light that gets trapped between two parallel mirrors. Energy illuminates the harmonics of the flow you are cultivating.

2. Joy

a) The judicious selection of sets of eigenmodes that are consonant together

b) Given joyous flow, deepening the joy entails energization, blending, and annealing of the consonant gestalt (cf. Focus on Positive)

3. Investigation

a) Examining the texture of flow. Testing it to determine the presence of hindrances.

b) It is listening for the ring of the flow (with its objects) and diagnosing what is in it

c. Tranquilizing Factors:

1. Tranquility

a) Cultivating tranquility entails developing highly-efficient cooling structures that channel flow and dissipate energy quickly (cf. Focus on Rest) (Delta Rivers)

2. Equanimity

a) Not interfering with energy transit and dissipation by letting it recruit as large of a piece of flow as possible for its diffusion
A

b) At a high-enough concentration, equanimity undergoes a phase change. It becomes very fluid which balances out the forces inside you. I can see how in large enough amounts this would significantly reduce the suffering associated with intense pain.

c) Remember the teachings of Rob Burbea (‚Äúwhat you resist persists‚Äù) and Shinzen Young (‚Äúsuffering equals pain times resistance, purification equals discomfort times equaminity, frustration equals pleasure times resistence, fulfilment equals pleasure times equaminity‚Äù)<ref>[[Purification and Fulfilment: Four Formulas ~ Shinzen Young - YouTube]([Purification and Fulfilment: Four Formulas ~ Shinzen Young - YouTube]([Purification and Fulfilment: Four Formulas ~ Shinzen Young - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u9nuSf9g1g))) Purification and Fulfilment: Four Formulas ~ Shinzen Young]</ref>. Essentially, resisting negative energies makes them stronger. This is doubly so on psychedelic states of consciousness. Instead, remember that high enough equanimity, where you don‚Äôt let positive or negative vibes ‚Äúmove you‚Äù, maximizes the rate of stress dissipation within your nervous system, and this accelerates the rate at which negative vibes flow through you and exit your system via some kind of radiative cooling process currently not understood by science. Practice taking cold showers without stalling or flinching, or eating relatively hot peppers without resisting or letting the pain get to you.

3. Concentration

a) It is hard to tell ‚Äúwhat you do‚Äù to increase concentration. As far as I can tell it requires a lot of skillful rhythmicity that guides awareness in a way that prevents its falling away.

b) A rough metric for concentration might be: amount of energy of flow that is in phase, in harmonic relationship, and synchronized. Thus, for any level of concentration there are many possible ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù. Only on the very high-levels of concentration do experiences become constrained to only a few types. The combinatorial space becomes smaller as concentration increases.

The holy grail here would be the creation of a high-entropy alloy that blends together all seven factors. It‚Äôs a bootstrapping process. As you start developing some of the factors, you can use them to weld the flow in such a way that developing the other factors becomes easier. Then you can start developing two or more factors simultaneously (e.g. ‚Äútranquil equanimity‚Äù or ‚Äújoyous concentration‚Äù). In time, one climbs the gradient that fortifies the presence of the factors in the mind, making it a home for wholesome qualia computing. More resonant network." <ref>[[Buddhist Annealing: Wireheading Done Right with the Seven Factors of Awakening | Qualia  Computing]([Buddhist Annealing: Wireheading Done Right with the Seven Factors of Awakening | Qualia  Computing]([Buddhist Annealing: Wireheading Done Right with the Seven Factors of Awakening | Qualia  Computing]([Buddhist Annealing: Wireheading Done Right with the Seven Factors of Awakening | Qualia  Computing]([Buddhist Annealing: Wireheading Done Right with the Seven Factors of Awakening | Qualia  Computing](https://qualiacomputing.com/2021/04/04/buddhist-annealing-wireheading-done-right-with-the-seven-factors-of-awakening/))))) Buddhist Annealing: Wireheading Done Right with the Seven Factors of Awakening]</ref>

'''abcdef. Deconstruction'''

Packets of consonant negentropy that when sent as messages are smoothening and dissolving bayesian markov blanket beliefs. The sharper (asymmetric) they are, the more they are something like dissonant knotted traumatic structures on the spectrum that can be healed by untangling.

What all can be deconstructed?

Senses can be modelled by 6 dimensions, different interacting fields: inner and outer visual, auditory and other senses in one field that include energy body, touch, taste, smell, feelings, thoughts. On jhanas or 5-MeO-DMT they can collapse to one field.

To be more descriptive:
Body, thoughts, breath, space, time, depth, sounds, objects, space around objects, attention, mechanisms of attention, energy, pressure, stress, pain, pleasant, unpleasant, contracted muscles, intent to meditate, anticipation, mental echo of phenomena - image and picture of the image, sound and mental image of the sound, intention of an action and the action (moving arm), intension to move attention and attention moving, anything we think is us or the other (subject and object), center, boundary, experiencer experiencing experienced, awareness awaring awared, personality, identity, social status, priorities, goals, thermostats, likes, dislikes, fun things, preferences, norms, morals, judgements, hiearchies, what is true, our ontology, ways of reasoning, concepts, categories, algorithms, body map, world map, anything discrete/dual in our sensory channels (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch) or thoughts (image or language, assumptions, hypotheses, beliefs, models, narratives, beliefs learned by the the environment or by us, distinction between us and the environment), feelings, emotions, fear or love of uncertainity, hate, anger, frustration, friction, love, kindness, compassion, prediction error, mind wandering, spacing out, memories, planning, seeking, thinking about thinking or sensations or actions, metacognition, edges, flow, habits, reinforcement of activities by unpredictable rewards, biases, selection confirmation bias, seek, fight, flight, freeze conditioned reactions and behaviors created by past experience of pain or pleasure and basic needs and valence/unity/interconnectedness/agreement/harmony/connectedness of/with us, others, environment, universe, everything, and something/someone giving us hope and uncertainity/dissonant error reduction, the fact that senses are not seen as one unified sense door, the fact that sensations are aware of themselves at their own place and are coming from void to void timelessly spacelessly, contractions, expansions, vibrations, blips, sensations are made of infinite something that is made of nothing, all of those identifying labels are empty evolutionary useful dreamlike mental constructions, emptiness is empty, duality is nonduality, separation is unity, emptiness is form. 

Enter nondual awareness by objectifying, relaxing, trying to locate and dissolving the center of experience. Notice that the awareness, not the self from the head, is conscious of contents of awareness. Everything is made out of clusters of tangled sensations that can be untagled. Each sensation is coming out of void, vibrating, vanishing into the void. Contracting and expanding at the same time.<ref>[[How to Do Nondual Vipashyana - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TkVzzgT868) Nondual vypashanya guided meditation by Michael Taft]</ref>

4: Reified caught in mind wandering in episode

5: Less mind wandering and thinking

6: More experiencing

7: Stepping back from, letting go, dropping away experiencing

8: Deconstructing self experiencing idea

9: Awareness of experience

'''abcdef. Center of awareness jumping out of your head/neck/heart/gut into vast space'''

Find a hole in the back of your head/neck/heart/gut and make your center of awareness jump out of it into vast space. It's a very efficient way of literally making your brain activitiy jump out of your default mode network (resulting in quieting your thinking mind) into the central executive network making you more able to dissolve contractions (symmetrify asymetries) (decontruct generative model's evolutionary useful structures) from this point of nondual centerless awareness.<ref>[[Finding Space and Freedom - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/ThelxB7sFa8) Holes guided meditation by Michael Taft]</ref>

'''abcdef. Jhanas as slowly lowering the information content of experience'''

Mind induced build up of joy. Pure loving perfect symmetrical flow! Symmetrification process in brain symmetrifying all other processes.

Focus on breath. Slow down breath. Smooth out breath sensations. Learn to see pleasantness in breath. Note it as many times per second as possible. Learn to see pleasantness in pleasantness itself. Stack this in feedback loop way into exponential explosion.

That is first Jhanas, there is nine of them: 

1st: Delightful Sensations, gladened mind, liking your experience

2nd: Joy: Cultivating rapturing joy by focusing on the pleasantness of breath

3rd: Contentment: Cultivating happiness in the background by being satisfied with what is

4th: Utter peacefulness: Letting go off joy and just resting in happiness

5th: Infinity of space by "imagining" or realizing absence of boundaries such as inflating baloon that eventualy pops

6th: Infinity of consciousness by becoming that space

7th: No-thingness by focusing on the nothingness of that space

8th: Neither perception nor non-perception by turning of all mental faculties, going beyond nothingness

9th: Cessation by turning off consciousness itself, restarting your whole nervous system, turning of all your proceeses in your generative model and blinking out of existence, sense of linear time of the story of your experience breaks down.<ref>[[How to Jhana ‚Äî with Michael Taft - YouTube]([How to Jhana ‚Äî with Michael Taft - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K5ypXyF3dY)) How to Jhana guided meditation by Michael Taft]</ref> <ref>[[How Is Jhana Like and Iggy Pop Concert? - YouTube]([How Is Jhana Like and Iggy Pop Concert? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mkYlus3ZLY)) How Is Jhana Like and Iggy Pop Concert? guided meditation by Michael Taft]</ref>

'''abcdef. Resting by doing nothing'''

Anytime mind enters a thought, jump out of it into vast still spacious awareness and rest in it. 

"Sit down and do nothing.

That‚Äôs it. Sit down and quite intentionally do nothing at all. Now keep on doing it.

However, most people need a little more instruction than that, so let‚Äôs unpack it a bit. Even though the meditation is called Do Nothing, you‚Äôre actually doing a little tiny bit of something: you‚Äôre paying attention to the feeling of doing something.

It doesn‚Äôt matter where your mind goes. It can go to all sorts of distraction, and that‚Äôs fine. You are not trying to meditate, focus, or concentrate in any way.

You‚Äôre simply noticing when you feel that you‚Äôre doing something and letting go of that.

If it feels like you‚Äôre getting caught up in a thought, let go of that. Don‚Äôt just sit there following thoughts, planning, evaluating, etc. That is considered to be doing something. Just let go of doingt hat.

If it feels like you‚Äôre getting caught up in an emotion, let go of that.

If it feels like you‚Äôre getting caught up in meditating, let go of that.

If it feels like you‚Äôre struggling to let go, let go of that.

If it feels like you‚Äôre constricting or tightening in your body, your emotions, or your mind, let go of that.

Just keep relaxing away from all tightening, constriction, or sense that you‚Äôre doing anything.

(Don‚Äôt) do this meditation for as long as you‚Äôd like. Make sure your awareness is bright and you are not fading or sleepy. Eventually the mind feels very spacious, open, and relaxed, but also bright, clear, and vivid.

Important Note: Over time I‚Äôve noticed that English speakers have two ways of understanding the verb ‚Äúto let go.‚Äù One meaning is ‚Äúto release.‚Äù The second meaning is ‚Äúto get rid of‚Äù or ‚Äúto push away.‚Äù Notice that the first of these is effortless, while the second implies a lot of effort. When I write ‚Äúlet go of that,‚Äù I‚Äôm talking about effortlessly releasing. You‚Äôre not trying to get rid of something, pushing anything away, or making a big effort." <ref>[[Do Nothing Meditation - Deconstructing Yourself]([Do Nothing Meditation - Deconstructing Yourself]([Do Nothing Meditation - Deconstructing Yourself]([Do Nothing Meditation - Deconstructing Yourself]([Do Nothing Meditation - Deconstructing Yourself]([Do Nothing Meditation - Deconstructing Yourself]([Do Nothing Meditation - Deconstructing Yourself]([Do Nothing Meditation - Deconstructing Yourself]([Do Nothing Meditation - Deconstructing Yourself]([Do Nothing Meditation - Deconstructing Yourself]([Do Nothing Meditation - Deconstructing Yourself]([Do Nothing Meditation - Deconstructing Yourself](https://deconstructingyourself.com/do-nothing-meditation.html)))))))))))) Do Nothing Meditation by Michael Taft]</ref><ref>[[Looking into Groundlessness - YouTube]([Looking into Groundlessness - YouTube]([Looking into Groundlessness - YouTube]([Looking into Groundlessness - YouTube]([Looking into Groundlessness - YouTube]([Looking into Groundlessness - YouTube]([Looking into Groundlessness - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqE39Q4kBiY))))))) Looking into Groundlessness Guided Meditation by Michael Taft]</ref>

'''abcdef. Solving trauma by healing the exile in loving nondual awareness'''

In order to allow and unify everything in the brain, some dissonant patterns in the bodymind can be so strongly destabilizing that they need healing.

[[File:Trauma.jpeg|500px|Alt text]]

"To heal a trauma response is to activate it at the same time as another schema that contradicts the trauma schema's assumptions in its own frame. in this context "schema" roughly means "pattern stored in bodymind memory that you learned to execute in response to something". When you trigger a schema it gets retrieved and you automatically act on it. This is often useful learning and sometimes extremely maladaptive. In juxtaposing the 2 you unlock the first schema for a ~5 hour window where it can be updated permanently.

The unlocking mechanism is precise and detailed but there's an infinite variety of ways of finding & retrieving the trauma schema, identifying & retrieving an appropriate contradicting schema, persuading the two schemas to juxtapose, providing new information to update on. Any given "standard" technique may or may not work for you depending on exactly what your trauma schemas are and "where in the bodymind" you've stored them, but there will be *some* way of unlocking it.

1. Identify an emotional belief

2. Dig for the original situation in which the emotional learning occurred that formed the belief

3. Make the inherent assumptions explicit in a non-judgmental way (i have to do X because of Y, or otherwise Z will happen)

4. Keep that belief in the foreground while presenting it with counterfactual evidence (e.g. Y is no longer true; better yet: i have not done X, but Z didn't actually happen this time)

5. Cognitive dissonance

6. Updated emotional belief system" <ref>[https://twitter.com/captain_mrs/status/1633841527951859714 Unlocking The Emotional Brain]</ref> 

New data can be contradicting the old ones with opposite scenario (different environment), love (interpersonal actual measured expression or "fabricated" one, MDMA or love and kindness to self, to/from others, to/from universe<ref>[[Mother Buddha Love - YouTube]([Mother Buddha Love - YouTube]([Mother Buddha Love - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qglWhEga4UU))) Mother Buddha Love guided meditation by Michael Taft]</ref>, meditation can help), or breakage of spacetime or self/other duality (transcendental deconstructive meditation or psychedelics can help).

<references/> 

In bayesian brain its a bayesian belief (learned neurons' correlations with its environment stored in the neurons and connections between them) update using new sensory data making the old generative model obsolete, phase shift in the parameter configuration space hopefully to a more smooth symmetrical consonant dynamics. 

"While there may be infinite parts within you, there are three main types: firefighters, managers, and exiles.

The firefighter parts are protectors that are activated when a trigger is present. An example of this might look like being reminded of a painful memory and using a behavior like substance use to put out the ‚Äúfire‚Äù of the pain.

The manager parts protect you by managing situations through intense planning to do whatever they can to avoid something that might bring you deep pain.

Both the firefighter and manager, according to the theory, work to keep the exile from emerging and flooding you with memories of pain and trauma."<ref>[https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-ifs-therapy-internal-family-systems-therapy-5195336 Internal Family Sytsems]</ref> 

Inside everyone is a complex ecosystem of trees and flowers and animals that interact and influence one-another, they grow together, the sun shines on them and the breeze blows through them, rain seeps into the ground.

"In parallel, it‚Äôs important to briefly mention the role that subagents typically have in us. Namely, what Romeo Stevens calls the ‚ÄúMr. Meeseeks interpretation of subagents‚Äù (Hi I‚Äôm Mr. Meeseeks! I see your grandmother is emotionally abusive. I‚Äôll pretend to be her inside your mind so that you can predict what she will do next and thus avoid getting harmed. Let me know when she‚Äôs gone so I can go *PUFF*.). The subagents are created to achieve a goal, they don‚Äôt really like existing, but will continue to hang in there until they‚Äôre convinced the goal has been met. The subagents are spun up in order to accomplish goals that would normally require you to spend a lot of attention but that cannot be simply offloaded to muscle memory (e.g. like driving a car). Typical examples are things like the response one may have to living in an environment with very negative people (say, dark triad personalities) where you need to spin up subagents that behave like them so that you can predict their next move. In cases of PTSD, it may be that part of the problem is that one created a lot of rather negative subagents (of people, situations, dynamics, actual physical hazards, etc.) and that as a collective they reinforce each other.

Here loving-kindness meditation can be enormously helpful. Essentially what you do is visualize a container of very positive benevolent and high-valence feelings (call it unconditional love, God, primordial goodness, Buddhamind, etc. ‚Äì or whatever really resonates in your inner world simulation). You then tell the story that subagents come out of that container and once they achieve their goals they go back to it in order to ‚Äúmerge with love‚Äù once again. You can even explain this to the subagents, and they can feel the sense of relief that comes when they finally achieve union with this primordial love. Gently guide them towards it. And if you do this over and over, you will in fact be cleaning up a lot of subagents lingering implicit in the field, until you achieve a smooth field with high-valence and a non-dual feel."<ref>[[Aligning DMT Entities: Shards, Shoggoths, and Waluigis | Qualia  Computing]([Aligning DMT Entities: Shards, Shoggoths, and Waluigis | Qualia  Computing]([Aligning DMT Entities: Shards, Shoggoths, and Waluigis | Qualia  Computing]([Aligning DMT Entities: Shards, Shoggoths, and Waluigis | Qualia  Computing]([Aligning DMT Entities: Shards, Shoggoths, and Waluigis | Qualia  Computing]([Aligning DMT Entities: Shards, Shoggoths, and Waluigis | Qualia  Computing]([Aligning DMT Entities: Shards, Shoggoths, and Waluigis | Qualia  Computing]([Aligning DMT Entities: Shards, Shoggoths, and Waluigis | Qualia  Computing](https://qualiacomputing.com/2023/03/05/aligning-dmt-entities-shards-shoggoths-and-waluigis/)))))))) Aligning DMT Entities: Shards, Shoggoths, and Waluigis]</ref><ref>[[Healing the Exile in Nondual Awareness - YouTube]([Healing the Exile in Nondual Awareness - YouTube]([Healing the Exile in Nondual Awareness - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cN5M_8r3Gc))) Healing the Exile in Nondual Awareness guided meditation by Michael Taft]</ref><ref>[[Contacting & Integrating Shadow Material - YouTube]([Contacting & Integrating Shadow Material - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaANMmPcjTY)) Contacting & Integrating Shadow Material guided meditation by Michael Taft]</ref>

'''abcdef. Changing one's mind aka construction'''

In this state, you are more prone to dissolving, transforming, or strenghtening your fundamental priors, as cortical hiearchy is more deconstructed.

Anytime there are discomfort or pain sensations, you can repeat to yourself "suffering equals pain times resistence, purification equals pain times equaminity" and I let the pain fully flow through you without blocking or denying it like a terminator and nothing can stop you. What you resist persists.

Meaningful life includes mode of being, mode of doing, and mode of becoming.

Acting from fullness, wanting to compassionately add to the whole we are part of, instead of taking away from it to fill the emptiness (in the western nihilist sense) in the heart.

Enough dose of conflicting data pressure might penetrates the statistical hull of the stable belief or world view structure and phase change to a different configuration of system of beliefs might happen. 

You can uninstall before mostly hidden from you irritation and fear conditionings by looking for exiles in your mind and letting them express themselves. You can desconstruct them or update them. Show them that they aren't needed anymore or that they can serve a better function. Usually they feel scared or hurt because of some past experience. Lubing them with love using love and kindness and gratefulness can help. Seeing the positive in the negative. Going through the episodic memory again by noticing that the environment actually wanted good for you, let it be people or the nurturing of the universe. Learning to see perfectness in every moment as part of a holistic mandala, accepting it.<ref>[[Everything in it's Right Place Meditation - YouTube]([Everything in it's Right Place Meditation - YouTube]([Everything in it's Right Place Meditation - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWC6dK0_O2g))) Perfectness Mandala guided meditation by Michael Taft]</ref>

Accepting you as you are is interconnecting with yourself. (Ideally balance between acceptance and change) Love and kindness and prosocial data interconnects you with others. Noticing the perfectness, love and caring of mother nature, accepting the world as it is, interconnects you with the world and reduces the need to change that generates desires, fear and stress. Death meditations dissolve the fear of mortality.<ref>[h[Not-Death Sangha - 14 March, 2020 - YouTube](https://youtu.be/yA7XpQXIHGw) Death Sangha guided meditation by Michael Taft]</ref>

You can notice something that you think is true. Some concept, some duality and find a middle way. Middle waying everything and metarational empirical scientific method of constructing models destroys all dogmas (defined as 100% certain beliefs) which liberates all mental constructions from absolute certainity.

If you want to engineer wellbeing, swim in estatic mental models, they share something in common, symmetry. Biology includes hardwired selective confirmation bias as a way to navigate error gradients, so under symmetry theory of valence it makes sense to navigate your selection bias towards symmetrical representations, which itself is a bias. Synthesis of maximizing predictivity and maximizing valence seems to be the optimal from what I've gathered. Nonduality is essencially about symmetries. Ultimate god mental construction includes everything, allows everything. Ultimate reality mental construction includes no and all concepts, nothing, everything are true, false, both and neither. It's always a mental model so abstract, so low constrain/structure/information which generates all models, a mental representation with the highest amount of internal symmetries. You can install those by listening to content about nonduality.

Someone who doesn't care about science and not wanting to spread information with less predictibility power can go for just wellbeing. There's danger that one gets stuck in something symbolic there though as one doesn't have the scientific metalens from my perspective. In a way we all go towards wellbeing using what we already have in our heads. 

Compassion feels good. Merging with the deity of compassion feels amazing and it reinforces your nervous system to help all beings. If you want to go this path, you can. Imagine [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqViREYXsAEf0nF?format=jpg&name=900x900 enlightened deity of compassion] on meditation in love and kindness context radiating love towards all beings and merge with it.

'''abcde. Substances'''

Psychedelics multiply the amount of consciousness, expand the mind, dissolve, strengten or mutate existing beliefs. 5-MeO-DMT adds extremely intense hyperattractor of higly symmetrical consonant (or dissonant) free high energy pocket of negentropy that result in ultimate neural annealing. DMT creates clusters of coherence. Stimulants make more specialized hyperfixated flow. Dissociatives remove the amount of consciousness, which can be useful for dissolving being stuck in an attractor as well. Cannabis also brings random connections. They bring you out of our usual thinking mind.

'''abcdef. DMT entity alignment'''

Reducing asymmetries (do nothing + love and kindness + deconstruction of all sensations meditation), making the chances of "beautifully consonant nondual DMT 5-MeO-DMTlike unity God of emptiness interconnecting entity" emerging, or entities being more harmonious together, higher.

'''abcde. Message and sex'''

Message can relax all muscles more, and relaxing the body relaxes the mind. Sex by itself is pleasant and can be precursor for Jhanas, and orgasm is ultimate relaxation of the mind, that can deeply interconnect people, even better with spiritual foreplay. Looking into eachother's eyes and synchronizing breathing is magical, as it can synchronize the minds as well.  

'''abcde. Audio'''

Nothing is ideal for experience of nothing or cessation - experience of nonexperience. Alternatively one can experience divine loving unity with [[Feel First Life - Jon Hopkins (Visualiser) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uqJSdXJi84) Feel First Life - Jon Hopkins (Visualiser)] or agressive deconstructing lubing negentropy pockets of energy with

'''abc. Solving the Meta Crisis with the Meaning Crisis by Social System Optimized for Transparency and Happiness'''

Meaning crisis is valence, interconnection, unity, experiental intensity, flow, internal and external value alignment, feeling values directly, crisis.
Fundamental core priors aka value realization. Selfactualization, selfrealization. Putting the self in the other. Achieving internal consonance of subject and object mental model.
Lubricating fundamental priors such as reminder of ontology and values (that's function of rituals and there is less of them now) and activating them by action directly feels meaningful because it creates very symmetrical dynamics in our minds.
We flourish in spaces driven by our values, not instrumental goals or preferences.
Meaning is a process, such as creative exploration, deep fundamental work, being voulnerable, or local farming.
Advanced meditation nicely kind of optionally sidesteps this by creating unconditional always active nondual fundamental prior that loves all experience.
Politics should speak more from values instead of instrumental goals and preferences for creating more unity, less polarization, of population.
Social media should maximize, satisfy our values (meaning) more rather than engagement and hijacking our attentional reward mechanisms in maladaptive ways.

Landscape of equally potentially effective solutions to the meaning crisis sharing the same structure, first definition, as I said before: Meaning is the sense of interconnectedness with us, others and everything. 

Rebuilding meaning group maped out the space of possible meanings corresponding to our values that people can have, such as deep work, creative brain storming exploration, voulnerable spaces, local farming, doing art,... - around 4000 of them depending on how detailed they are needed. This is and can be futher used to redesign social media to maximize meaning more than engagement (as they seem to be one main cause of the unhapiness and mental discomfort of the youth) and to build retreats or social communities where there are spaces in a train optimized for fullfilling our values and creation of deep social connections. They have a language model as a chatbot that can figure out around 5 of your value cards by giving you questions better than humans can. Facebook has already tuned the objective functions of their machine learning algorithms to focus slightly more on meaning rather than just engagement. <ref>[https://www.rebuildingmeaning.org/ REBUILDING SOCIETY ON MEANING]</ref>

<references/> 

By talking and behaving in the language of meaning aka our fundamental values instead of conceptual labels, boxes as identities that polarize us instead, society would feel more synchronized, united, synchronized, on avarage. Which could also result in less economical inequality. Different political ideologies, religions, or philosophihies have much more in common when one focuses on meaning instead of instrumental goals and preferences. In a society full of value realizations in space trains there is much less friction. Tribalism will always be there, this is about reducing the friction as much as possible. Happier societies seem to experience less friction among today's world and through history. Values are okay as long as they dont destroy values of others in terms of wars and killing. To design this in social media and systems: Instead of closed communities on Discord or totally open pages on Facebook, instead of closed communities in villages or corporate consumerism, you can have something in middle: interacting communities in space trains designed to fullfill meaning, for example mutual creative deep work on shared topics such as the science of wellbeing with the artist community, where everyone gives feedback to eachother as they produce, where the line between producing and consuming blurs. Getting inspriation from the structure of science: System of retreat makers giving ideas to eachother and designing retreats, testing them, making them for groups of friends.

Each value corresponds to a need for community where this value can be realized. One practical intervention can be asking the population about their values using a questionare, more efficiently with the chatbot I menationed. Ask them if they are fullfilled, or analyzing what existing communities for what values exist and what are missing, and creating them. Being a vector in he societal space that pushes the emergence of communities, as some are inhabited by introverts a lot and they have lower chances of creating communities.

What synchronizes us? Big cluster of people such as hippies or nondual philosophers or (epistemological) anarchists seem to resonate on the value of the sense of freedom. everyone uses different physical or mental tools to get the same kind of internal value actualize itself in the world. 

If we really wanna unify absolutely everyone, we are all trying to reduce uncertainity about our sensory data, as Free Energy Principle postulates, or we all try to reduce internal dissonance, as Symmetry Theory of Valence postulates. We try to reach stable happiness using the mental and physical tools that we know.

Redirecting society from empirically disproven belief that if you have more money than you need for the cost of your living that it will make you happier. Popularizizing everything I'm writing in this book in the culture instead. Denormalizing chronic stress that breaks down everything in the body and mind. 

Connection with us can be created by working on us, analyzing us, training to love us, inner spiritual work. 

Connection with others is created by community that resonates with us culturally (philosophy, ideology,...), couple of clouse friends and significiant other we resonate with across as many scales as possible in psychology, not just physical attraction.

Connection with the universe and everything is the sense of being part of something greater, something transcendental. Paradigm of emergence or god consciousness. Siblings in the wound of creation on groundless ground, interconnected beyond space and time. Cultivating flow, harmony with what is in the present moment. 

Social media seems to destroy those structures as the lizard brain cannot tell the difference between social media and real world interconnection, and also atomization via globalization happens leading to the destruction of stable local communities as models in our social graphs. Killing our attention also destroys this.

Finding the balance between accepatnce and change, respecting existing structures but pushing change towards greater sum of wellbeing of people.
Satisfy as much needs of people as possible with the least friction possible mathematically.
Take in account behavioral psychology and evolution - people are diverse with diverse needs influenced by nature and nurture, social hiarchiers are emergent, trust and connection between people is hard to scale.
Being ok with less technologic/economic progress for more wellbeing progress (destressing)
Ideologies are too ideological and specialized for certain types of people or behaviors, we are more diverse systems.
Making society more liberated and compassionate through culture and politics (coordination), sense of connection with others leads to more happiness and coordination - nondual ideologies, meditation.

Predictions for the short term future:

My take on GPT-4 and AGI and other existencial risks. I'm taking in account all perspectives. People expect doom, utopia, singularity, progress, nothing. I think truth is in the middle. AI technology will transform society. There will be pain and happiness, but not collapse. What do you think?

By trying to follow all possible perspectives around AGI and existencial risks, my nervous system oscillates between all possible predictions depending on what I'm exploring. :D

Since people are extra bad at long term predictions and doomers, worshippers, or hippies have always existed in similar situations regarding technological revolutions, potential existential risks, or religious fabrications, it's interesting to watch and ride on the train or calm the people that are freaking out. :D 

I think the economic singularity or misaligned AGI destroying humanity is probably a bit much, but I had a dream where the singularity visited me it was a mega religious experience.
 
My most stable prediction is: it will be similar to when a lot of jobs were automated in the industrial revolution, in practice a lot of jobs will fall away through AI automation, but not something along the lines of everything collapsing or everyone dying, maybe it will boost capitalism further? If Uncle Ted Kaczynski could see that. D: There's going to be chaos from people getting traumatized by the language models like Sydney or people getting hurt physically from robots, but I don't think it's going to be totally uncontrollable. AI will be a mega useful tool in both good and bad hands, the transhumanism type (AI therapists, medical research, VR, art, creativity, robopets, creating happiness?) or China type (social credit system, cyberweapon propaganda, bioweapons?). 

I tend to think that society is slowly going towards collapse from more internal stress due to a ton of factors ala Holy Roman empire, but I'm trying to ground myself there as I suspect it's overblown via negative bias and doom ideas I explore here and there, and its being mixed with an optimistic positive bias that sees utopia in the future ala transhumanism. But who knows, I think it will be something in the middle, maybe for the worse when one looks at mental health stats for the young from hospitals or the economy or the climate or war risks. :smile: But we tend to crawl out of almost every destabilizing situation through adaptation. There will definitely be changes, there will be pain and happiness, but I don't foresee an apocalypse or collapse that strongly.

Imagine China's ugraded supercapistalist AGI government that is misaligned from original autoritarian capitalist goal because we're terrible at even encoding the goals properly in the neural networks and it would accidently start maximizing wellbeing of people! :D

Predictions for the long term future and how to solve it:

Applying statistical physics flavoured evolutionary game theory to global social system to navigate the interconnected landscape of existencial risks for humanity in order to find evolutionary stable strategic longterm solutions of not selfdecostructing ourselves soon with stuff like nuclear war, climate change or bio/cyberweapons because of caring for individual short term safety instead of global long term safety.

Existencial risks are negative sum games.
Climate change, AI development, microplastics, arms races, nuclear/bio/cyber weapons.
One agent increases his security and decreases security of other agents as they evolutionarily compete.
Agents dont trust eachother and assume worst case scenario, let's not get technologically and economically handicapped relative to competition and create climate change regulations.
Nobody wants destruction and extinsion but those underlying dynamics emergently happen as a result of a coordination failure. 

There is increasing amount of existencial risks with increasing probabilities lately. 
Existencial risks leading to collapse have always been a thing, like the Holy Roman empire, but it was much more local, we are more globalized now with interconnected dependant global supply chains and memes spread more globally, so the whole planetary life support system is overall more fragile. 

Free nature resources extraction by exponential technology so that everyone grows exponentially (superpositive sum games) and global monetary ecosystem as solution to no WW3. 
That might be now breaking with NATO vs Russia plus China as we're reaching the limits of what we can extract from nature that doesn't have enough time to regenerate the extracted comodities so rivalities to get others' commodities through force to grow become similarly plausible options again. 

Who survives by Universal Darwinism is who didnt get eaten, who won wars and had economic growth. 
We have radically more distributed warfare. 
We're on fragile interconnected network grid. 
Metacrisis: We're on selfterminating race. 

Fragmentation of our world view is the underlying problem leading to our problems in society, ability to identify with one ingroup and go into rivaly with another outgroup, optimizing particular metric while externaliting harm to another metrics, the ability to benefit the near term while damaging the long term, all of those are special cases of percieving parts rather than wholes, which ended up actually damaging the wholes and parts themselves through the interdependence of parts. 

We must take on account all technological, environmental, economical, geopolitical variables.
Clusters of people compete for exponentially growing population resource growth through wars or cooperation in terms of power.

Thanks to industrial revolution we have nash equilibrium with nukes and globalized economy, cold war. Those are more monitorable through satelites. More than exponentially growing democratized bio/cyberweapons with linear nature resources might destroy this. 

Two attractors that the society is heading to:

Decentraliztaion - less regulatory control over groups with exponential tech leading to higher chances of existencial risks, but more freedom to do stuff, ancap dystopia?

Centralization - can catch and deal with the landscape of existencial risks but too much regulations, potential for authoritian regime, centralized power, uneven conditions, it's not clear that what will be maximized is power of the top class instead of survival of the species anyway 

Evolutionary competition happens either way, between clusters of centralized groups with exponential tech maximizing their short term safety at the cost of long term global safety because of finite resources and for living stable conditions of the environment.

Solving multipolar traps:

What do these two attractors of catasrophies and dystopia have in common? Distrust, opaqity, secretness between agents... Democracy aka parcipitatiry governance doesn't work with secret goverment information about the state not shared to citizents because of fear of information disadvantage with rivals.

Potential solution: Full trust and transparency between agents' doings/insides? Sweden military seems to partially do this, with less money being spent on making information secret and it seems to work. It can lead to information disadvantage, less asymmetries generating power over the other. Forced global transparency sidesteps this as everyone gets the same disadvantage resulting in more global safety with less overall tension. Absolute symmetry? Results in global coordination on global survival? If only people implicitly synchronized. Increasingly smaller actors can use destructive technology in increasingly destructive ways. 

How to create global survillance to manage the interconnected landscape of existencial risks that's not dystopic Orwell style? China is banning polarization technologies (social media) for example, regulating memeplexes. Honestly how synchronized they are is sometimes fascinating. But from our point of view and many of them its very dystopic. Global existencial risks are still a thing from negative sum games between superpowers.

Shifting society to language of unified meaning and values instead of polarizing identity boxes.

We dont want short term loosing to other agents or long term selftermination.

We dont want cascading catasrophies (climate change, weaponized technology,...) and clear dystopia (asymmetries of power, almost everyone has almost no freedom) 

exponential tech -> decentralized power -> coordination failures, benefiting agent's safety short term at the cost of everyone, multipolar traps -> increasing catasrophies -> Amazon versus Microsoft's military ancap wars as there's no monopoly on violence (police)

But also:

exponential tech -> centralized power -> AI monitoring sensors everywhere -> potential for Orwell autocratic feudalistic dystopia

Sweden:
Assuming rivals will probably find out secret goverment information anyway -> not investing any resource in hiding opaqueness -> population are what's going on in the country -> population has more trust in government -> less money spent on champaigning and convincing people of things, more emergent coordination, various goverment deparments and military know more what eachother is doing (less information transmission blockages, more coherence) and can more easily coordinate, corruption is also more seen thanks to the transparency and can be dealt with -> some information asymmetry disadvantage related to other rival countries but a lot of other disadvantages, different local minima valley in the adaptive landscape

Too much information though leads to not everyone being able to process it so it doesn't matter of its transparent or not, information singularity, can ve processed via computational compression: AI summarization for example.

It seems that something similar Is happening in Czechia, the new Czech president literally has a YouTube podcast.

The trust in president got higher here but the trust in government apparently lowered (it seems that there are more left leaning people in the population who's values aren't that represented in the elected government because of bad weird rules and bad luck in last elections thanks to formings of coalitions to succesfully take down a populist corrupt oligarch) 

I love how internal symmetrification of information works for both the mind and the nation to achieve better health
Better communications between government deparments is same as better communication between brain centers

For USA: 

More strategic military capacity could emerge our of transparency -> leading to Russia and China trying to do the same thing to not lose the multipolar trap of racing to the top of transparency rather than race to the bottom of opaqueness -> more potential for international agreement and fundamentally adressing the multipolar trap aggressively better

Multipolar traps are scenarios where the things that work well for individuals locally are directly against the global well-being.
Forced transparencies strategies making them more capable of winning: International satelites, Opensource

This culture more oriented to peacefulness could beat the counterculture?
Becoming more warring without becoming more warring in all the most problematic ways
Could this symmetry voulnerability create much more easier conditions for negative actors tho
On the other hand open source software could be prefixed by collective of positive actors before negative actors finding out 
Decreasing pathological competition within the system
Maintaining adequate strategic capacity
More positive sum games
Something that wont make one agent's start of a cascade make him not lose to other agents and influences the rest of the world 

Enlightened country is nice but it will still die to global issue of climate change thanks to USA/Russia/China 

Nature of what it makes it win isnt externaliting harm or driving arms races
Obseleting destructive game theory
And winning at some fundamental game theory at the same time 
More transparency -> more coordination and less collective action failures, less incentive evolutionary pressure for psychopaths, sociopaths, narrcisists, worse conditions for hiding the stuff that one is doing 

Transparency is hard to scale because of those negative actors
Collective intelligence technologies such as interconnected global internet communication to the rescue?
Noticing perverse incentives, accounting them and externalities, and creating progressively better incensives and more capable detterence to align the motivation of individual agents with the whole better
Some of the exponential computational technologies that portend the fastest and worst existencial risks in many ways also portend possibility for better coordination systems
Not AGI singleton disintermediating humans and running the world
But AI and other capacities being to fascillitate collective intelligence. AI not making decisions by itself but processes of collective intelligences of humans making it.

People voting yes no on binary propositions where both sides of the propositions suck. If it goes through it benefits something and harms something else. That kind of proposition is designed badly and doesnt factor how interconnected everything is so they yes no cant not polarize the population, that would be a stupid system.
Before making the proposition, doing sense making what are all the interconnected things, what are all the values you take as design constrains to go through a better proposition crafting process of what is the best synergestic satisfier with the least theory of tradeoffs possible and what are better voting systems than binary that inherently polarize the population.
More education in topics, incentifying more ability to influence those topics
How to solve information singularity, more information than anyone can process? More journal articles on a topic than any expert can read so nobody can be an expert on anything. How to solve it? Make AIs run the world? Merge with AIs?

Value systems have to bind guide and direct the technology and influence social systems that create the capacity to bind guide and direct technology and markets in the way that they are not currently doing it. 
Technology is a new capacity and that capacity if rightly directed can make new things possible.
Steer global society away from selfdestruction towards consciousness utopia! 

Choices that take our attention in phones or capitalism hijack our basic needs instead of aligning with our highest goals.
Use wisdom to develop wisdom in people through designing technology. 

Can we make the types of transparency the types of incentive alignment the types of capacity for deterrence that would exist at small tribal type scale possible at much larger scales, where the intcrease in effective coordination starts to be more effective, reducing huge amount of waste and duplication and failures of those kinds. What makes this thing adaptive and selective in game theoretic situation is also what makes it healthy in terms of wellbeing of people inside and relative to eachother.<ref>[https://civilizationemerging.com/ Daniel Schmachtenberger]</ref>

Solving meta and meaning crisis by increasing collective transparency, trust, compassion, happiness as reaction for others' happiness, reducing addiction, where addiction is defined as selfdestructive/compulsive behavior that goes against one's goals and decreases cognitive flexibility. 

In order to keep wellbeing even in the chaos, just vibe with the environment and maybe embrace omnipotent misaligned AGI in climate change in collapsing civilization while helping remaining people survive with loving joyous compassion while in pure blissful peaceful equanimous stressfree vast spacious accepting state of mind.

'''abc. Artificial General Intelligence and Alignment'''

Andres mapped out the space of clusters of human emotions and transition functions between them with data science. Rebuilding meaning group mapped out the space of possible meanings corresponding to our values encoded in a language model. Put this space of our values into existing AGI language models. Encode it in maths used to model biological systems as fundamental priors corresponding to neural correlates and synchronize it with biology inspired selforganizing AGI - Selforganizing optical spiking transformers?

Can we take the mathematical models on how people synchronize in neuroscience (vibing by same resonant wave modes) and use them to build artificial agents such that they synchronize with us. 
That could constrain their statespace of solutions to more values aligned attractors. 
It seems to me that mathematics of Active Inference combined with Connectome Harmonics is a very promising path towards aligned AGI.
Because we can literally copy the brain (consonance, synchrony of bayesian values) as the same maths is used for brain and AI modelling.

Every cell is a reinforcement learning agent on its own, not just neuron cells. But neurons communicate in long distances with axons like telegraph.
One can do learning global functions that tell neurons how to respond to patterns in their neighborhood. <ref>[[Generalist AI beyond Deep Learning - YouTube](https://youtu.be/p-OYPRhqRCg?t=2825) Generalist AI beyond Deep Learning]</ref>

'''ab. Philosophy and other things

'''abc. Mental constructions'''

'''abcd. Truth'''

What is truth?

In the feelings of something being deeply true: The more overall consonant/symmetrical the dynamics (that the mental state corresponds to) is, the truer it feels, the more the insight wants to stick (how the definition interlocks with the whole mental framework is important)

different kind of proofs/truths:
philosophers: it feels good
mathematicians: its derived from these axioms under these rewriting rules 
scientists: all (or most) (or in just some context) empirical data supports this model, so its true (or partially true) (or true just in this context) until its not
engineers: boom! it fookin works, i got Doom to run on this alien computer using selfconstructed biology inspired bioelectromagnetic selforganizing system with adaptive hiearchical crossscale harmonic bayesian beliefs with goals and actions ü•≥

What seems true to us can be seen as sensory patterns that satisfy our learned neural classifiers aka energy sinks the most, that generate the highest positive valence (consonant dynamics) in the mental framework (background resonant wave modes) that we are inhabiting, that we annealed to, what software we or the environment installed to us.<ref>[[Subjective signal strength distinguishes reality from imagination | Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37322-1) Subjective signal strength distinguishes reality from imagination]</ref>

If the world model feels stronger, we assign world as ontologicaly primal. 
If the self model feels stronger, we assign consciousness as ontologicaly primal. 
If its equal or one signal, it merges or transcends. 

You have a thesis and an antithesis and then Hegel's idea is you have a synthesis which is a kind of higher order truth that understands how those relate in a way that neither of them do and its at a higher order of complexity. The first part would be: Can I steal man each of these, can i argue each one well enough that the proponents of it are like: "Totally you got that!" and not just argue it rhetorically, but can I inhabit it where i can try to see and feel the world the way someone seeing and feeling the world that way would, because once i do then, I don't want to screw those people, because there's truth in it, and i'm not going to go back to war with them, I'm going to go to finding solutions, it could actually work at a higher order. If i don't go to a higher order, then there's war, the higher order approach can generate cooperation, coordination, peace, love, friendship, connection, mutual understanding, empathy, through complexity.

‚ÄúIt seems plain and self-evident, yet it needs to be said: the isolated knowledge obtained by a group of specialists in a narrow field has in itself no value whatsoever, but only in its synthesis with all the rest of knowledge and only inasmuch as it really contributes in this synthesis toward answering the demand, ‚ÄòWho are we?'‚Äù

'''abc. Final contemplation about physicalist and mental theories of everything and oneness'''

The deeper you go into deflatory more predictive models about empirical data, the less intuitive (comprehensible for our usual by evolution preihstalled mental data structures) one becomes when trying to communicate it to others ((ontology agnostic) quantum mechanics, Amplituhedron)

In this book i mostly reason from ontology agnostic classical thermodynamics of bayesian statistics, but adding some more Quantum theory (Chris Fields) or Amplituhedron (going beyond spacetime, which is not fundamental but emergent there) would make it extremely hard grasp for the classical neural classifiers in our mind. Its all just in different contexts useful labels for models for predicting data, and their validity is being supported by empirical data. 

In a certain lens when constructing models we are approximating the brain dynamics trying to predict our sensory data and those brain dynamics have an extreme complexity and the more you try to describe the nature of experience, the more iffeable it seems. We may never fully know the experiental or scientific truth as we may never construct a model that predicts all empirical data. 

Easiest theory of everything for free is taking the finite set of all measurments that we got recorded so far and create input output lookup table from it and that's it. Then slowly deflate and compress it by various symmetries. Machine learning is also helping us find patterns in dynamical systems. There may be different theories of everything, with many isomoprhisms, and their count depends on the amount of abstraction of the different theories of everything. It's all many lenses useful for different domains going from different angles.

All of this is for engineering useful set of interacting data structures in our experience. Ontology agnostic bayesianism aka metarationality doesn't care what is fundamental, if everything is matter or consciousness or both. Freedom from fundamentality of fundamental symbolic concepts "is fundamental" including freedom from this freedom! Philosophical problems as linguistic confusion? Everything is just a nebulous dream-like rainbow-like mental construction. No source, destination, concepts. Groundless ground. Emptiness is empty too. If you think you understand emptiness then you don't understand emptiness. In another lens this mental construction is the most useful one for generating constant sense of liberation when it comes to concepts. For futher liberation do some meditation. "Truth" is end of mind, end of knowledge, and that's freedom. Metaalgorithm that when applied to all mental constructions creates the most satisfying total mental framework as it creates symmetries between all dualities, language, concepts. It dissolves all abstract thought in general.

I'm curious why EM models of consciousness tend to not talk about other forces in the standard model. I suppose because they're much less common. What if they're also part of the consciousness dynamics equation as electromagnetism is everywhere in biological systems, but something still has to hold atoms together (strong force), certain radioactive isotopes are present in biological systems and decay (weak force), gravity is around every mass, and forces are interactions of matter so matter is needed in the equation as well.

We can think of brain on hardware and software level. There is conscious and subconscious software that can be directly or indirectly programmed by ourselves by knowledge, metacognition, theraphy etc., or it can be programmed by our culture, environment, under the genetic constrains of hardware. 

Most of variance in IQ is explained by hardware (Twins separated at birth into different families study)

NOIR is a general-purpose, intelligent BRI system that enables humans to command robots to perform 20 challenging everyday activities using their brain signals, such as cooking, cleaning, playing games with friends, and petting a (robot) dog.

Developing AGSI poses lots of harmful risks and potential failure modes for our system that may create suffering for all of sentience before or after AGSI is reached (opression, wars, extinction...), but if we get it right, there is a big potential for future where all of sentience flourishes with wellness.
Risks will always exist, its about minimizing them in the aggregate. If we dont develop AGSI soon, there might be higher probability of getting killed by other factors, like nukes, biorisk, nanotech risk, climate change, natural causes, or getting into opressive dystopia or chaotic breakdown full of tribal wars, with radical social, economic, technological or intelligence inequality, which itself might even be accelerated by AI, but all tools are dual use aka omni use, it might also be the other way around if we direct it correctly into a future where all sentient beings, maybe even beyond humans, flourish in wellness!

Jhanas are that you increase entropy so much that you end up with all information/no information state of consciousness, where the system has potential to be all possible states but none of them (still restricted by biology and deep functions preventing physically dying), increasing the possible states until you end up with nothing by gradual underfitting

Mathematics is the ultimate symbolic strict compression language

Every thing is a computationally reducible pocket of the Rualid.

What pullback attractor in the statespace of consciousness, or statespace of generative models, or slice of Ruliad, or infinity groupoid, or dynamics of interacting and merging Markov blankets, topological pockets, physics, information, or what part of platonic mathematics, or God, nature, ieaffble, or all possible ontologies, or imaginings, constructions, are "you" inhabiting?

Every thing corresponds to some (quasi)stable mathematical model analyzable and predictable by all sorts of mathematics encoding physical systems evolving in (relativistic) (quantum) spacetime across interacting scales using stochastic dynamical systems theory using machinery from classical+statistical+relativistic+quantum mechanics, from particle to wave to fluid mechanics to markov blankets to cybernetic complex systems. We can take the statespace of things that science analyzes and map out the statespace of mathematics used to analyze them all, and semantic content framing it, automatically by scanning all of science information on the internet using scraping and data summarizing and compressing AI in a giant lookup table or or semantic map or fuzzy nested metagraph with nodes as things and (fuzzy) relations encoding similarityness (what math equations or semantics are used), inclusion, connection, hiearchies, causality etc. Disciplines as evolutionary attractors in scientific progress can be mapped out by semantic similarity and dimensional clustering. All of this could be added as knowledge database for scientific AGI.

From Wellbeing to Protopia with Artificial Intelligences: Philosophy, Science, Humanity, and its Future

I wonder if moral circle has literally some circleshaped neural dynamics correlate in the compassionate part of the brain

The Friedmann equations are fundamental formulas in cosmology that describe the expansion of the universe. They show how factors like the density of matter, the curvature of space, and the cosmological constant (a measure of the energy density of empty space) influence this expansion. In simpler terms, these equations tell us how the universe grows and evolves over time based on what it's made of and the properties of space itself. Think of them as cosmic rules that dictate how the universe stretches and evolves from the Big Bang to its future state.

Qualia is the most general concept

Visualize book as a tree

Linguists make language more structured than it actually is from a statistics perspective





the few bad parts of trips (two out of three i had alone) gave me sooo much myself

there are different types of bad trips, but in the ones i had, there's something in how the mind shows you (shoves into your face) veeeery directly and clearly in raw form what actually is wrong in your life/mind and you see much more clearly what changes in behavior, thinking and goals you should do

it creates much more inner alignment as emotional part of the brain, and planning one, and one encoding the self and so on, much more communicate together and figure out whats currently the biggest collective systemic burden and create a plan together

literally jumping out of bad local minima into a better one

it can mean quantizing gravity, unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, unify other fundamental forces not just gravity, explaining all other things in physics (like dark energy), making everything else (classical, relativity) emergent from quantum mechanics, or make everything including quantum mechanics emergent from something third (strings, loops, whatever), how chemistry, biology etc. emerges, explaining consciousness, how chemistry, biology etc. causally influences eachother, how everything inside these fields work (how to predict all of biology?), explaining everything else in philosophy including free will and ethics, using empirical vs math vs logic vs philosophical or normal language

or some hyperspecific subset "theory of everything of this ultra unknown concept in this niche subsubsubsubsubdiscipline"

and i see all models as just approximating reality, so i dont really believe in ultimate theory of everything that can predict absolutely everything in absolute certainity, we dont even have infinite compute, limits in measuring, limits in our locality/subjectivity/reference frame, nonability to conduct arbitrary experiements

nobody can be expert today in any bigger field (some ultra niche filed maybe?) as the enourmous amount of scientific papers with the knowledge explosion is insane and following that is impossible, im now trying to keep up with AI progress and its impossible even when i have lots of free time now, and philosophy seems so infinitely giant and so many positions on everything, i feel like that rabbithole is practically infinite and you can generate arbitrary new positions on many things where there might be some overlap with others

i love being generalizer thats now more focusing on AI and I might try to become more expertish on language models in practice from engineering lens now so i played with huggingface's transfomers for sentiment analysis yesterday for example, imma play with some pytorch models now

I love zero ontology. Why is there something rather than nothing? Existence of superposition of everything aka nothing is the default. it seems to experientally dissolve and expand the mind similarly like many world interpretation of quantum mechanics. :D

Smartphones, LLMs, external memory (notes, wikis, lectures, Obsidian,...), are extensions of our collective intelligence 

Lets infer semantic map from biggest trained open source large language model weights to visualize the statespace of human knowledge, or Wikipedia

In 10 years, we'll merge with machines and extend our brain to have all of human knowledge with thousands of trillions of connections instead of just a few trillions of connections 

Mapping out the entire state space of human knowledge is an extraordinarily complex task, as it encompasses all of human understanding across various domains, cultures, and time periods. Human knowledge is vast, multidisciplinary, and constantly evolving, making it nearly impossible to map out completely and accurately. Here's high-level overview of the major domains of human knowledge to give you a sense of its breadth and depth.

### 1. Natural Sciences
- **Physics**: Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Electromagnetism, Relativity
- **Chemistry**: Organic, Inorganic, Physical, Analytical, Biochemistry
- **Biology**: Genetics, Evolution, Ecology, Microbiology, Physiology
- **Astronomy**: Cosmology, Planetary Science, Stellar Astronomy
- **Earth Science**: Geology, Meteorology, Oceanography, Environmental Science

- **Neuroscience**: Study of the Nervous System, Combining Biology, Psychology, and Medicine

This map is by no means exhaustive and represents just a fraction of human knowledge. Each of these domains can be further subdivided into numerous subfields, and there are countless interdisciplinary areas that bridge multiple domains. Additionally, this map doesn't capture the knowledge held by various cultures around the world, much of which may not be formally documented or widely recognized.

Now lets recursively map out the statespace of each subsection

I'm just another biological computer doing all sorts of information processing and it's fun to play with processing anything, and ideally if it helps other beings!

We have a few trillions connections in our brain, LLMs have a few billion connections in 2023. We compute houndreds operations per second according to Ray Kurzweil, (but we can also say brains compute 100 billlion operations per second in information theory, he probably means conscious operations) but computers compute billions of operations per seconds. Computers and LLMs are already much faster and better at certain tasks than big chunk or all of humans. Simple coding, doctors, advanced calculators, percise engineering, drawing, some reasoning... Tech giants are working on multimodal AIs 100x the size of current best LLMs, like Google's Gemimi, that will be probably released in a next few months. We are getting bigger and bigger AIs, with more compute and data, and even better AI optimized hardware, software, and better architectures, and its all growing exponentially. It's alsmost impossible to follow all of this and adapt. Multiagent collective artificial intelligence systems for complex task solving simulating whole companies are emerging like Autogen. Embodied robotics getting solved with internal model of the physical world like nVidia's Eureka. Robotics getting ulgraded by ChatGPT in Boston dynamics! We might soon be merging our brain connections with machine connections via the neocortex in synergy! It's all crazy!

According to the standard cosmological model, the Big Bang was a state of very high density, temperature, and entropy. As the universe expanded and cooled down, it became more ordered and structured, forming stars, galaxies, planets, and life. This decrease of entropy in some regions of the universe was possible because the total entropy of the universe increased, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.

embracing the fullness of the absolute connection and total disconnection
raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw
by experiencing both extremes, total unity and total disunity
one is absolutely positive valence another one is totally negative valenced
its like an elastic band
its facinating how many ways one can cultivate connection
we do so many things for that
social signaling 
helping tribe/humanity 
just vibing
just existing
making eachother safe
exploring intelectually what is needed or abitrary things
i feel like our culture doesnt have enough machinery to cultivate this social connection properly leading to loneliness epidemics and so on leading to inability to act globally

metanote:
I'm wondering if i should bottom up build physical reality as i do it now, first building math and explaining fundamental particles and cosmology (classical -> quantum -> relativity -> merging to QTF standard model), and then go to middle scales such as biology and sociology.

Or should i bottom up build math (when i mention dynamical systems and classical mechanics i say everywhere where its applied, from small particles to big ones, as most of science is in classical framework, and explaining fundamental particles at the end because thats where i get to QTF math).

If i should go into biology when i already explain enough math (most of it is classical so including it inside classical dynamical systems), or if i should postpone it after i explain fundamental physics fully first.

Or first build all math without practically applying and then do a big section on just applications? But without examples that can be hard to grasp, and its almost impossible not to use examples when explaining physics without it seeming too abstract.

It's probably better to keep the scientific fields together, instead of keeping maths together.

Succesfull dieters have elevated at rest and evoked activity in aMCC, but failure mode there is anorexia
Obese people also have lower activity in aMCC
Stimulating it makes people feel like something's about to happen, putting pressure on them, and they felt like they have to act and move with their will, urgency to resist, to push back, getting ready, being the forward center of mass. 
It communicates with so many other networks and redistributes glucose to different functional networks as energy to act.
We can strenghten this network via learning to do things we resist, by excercise.

Instead of Christianity, Islam or other religions/ideologies/cults/other concrete cultural frameworks dominating globally, I would prefer secular open spiritual movements (like mindfulness movements) combined with rational enlightenement to tackle bigger humanity issues beyond individual cultures.

Lots of mainstream Christianity feels outdated in many ways, not fast enough with adaptation for humanity to not selfdestruct globally and minimizing suffering using empirical methods.

I see lots of good in it that's relevant for the current state of the world, take that and synthetize them with other religions and secular cultural frameworks.
 
Spinoza's God=Nature is IMO ideal and I often implement it in my mind for pragmatic purposes. But I'm open to many other as long as it doesn't increase the chances of humanity's state getting worse (wellbeing, progress, sustainability,...) 

Even Christian dogmatism is sometimes useful, but too much of it feels like failure mode. For example closedmindedness to different types of thinking that might have its own advantages and disadvantages in different contexts. And tolerating different types of behavior that might not be destructive at all in this context, like judging people having sex before marriage.

I dont adopt Christian framework because they're not general enough in maximizing wellbeing and sustainability globally and closes the mind against other frameworks, where all the different types of frameworks include something useful for the benefit of all sentience but any one framework system isnt enough. I believe one should be constantly openminded to new perspectives and religions or cults tend to go towards the opposite - not all and not all subgroups tho, which is good.

So I hope humanity wont become strictly Christian, but also not totally closed to its insights. Nuclear war is one of the possible extinction scenarios, and friction between religions/ideologies/cults from the degree of dogmatic closedmindedness, nontolerance, nonhumanism etc. isn't helping.

But I see the value of them in stabilizing communities and societies through social cohesion using rituals, shared thinking and patterns in behavior etc.. But I want a sweet spot that won't lead to death and suffering.

Is the recent war middle east a dispute over land, or about which cultures dominate over a region, and how that cultures are defining themselves, and highly fluid organizational, legal, religious, ethnic and social constructs being tied into these definitions in various complex and contradictory ways?

I want to minimize the total amount of suffering and death (possibly globally) by any means of organizational, legal, religious, and social construct transformation. Same in Russia x Ukraine.

Depending on what kind of (neuro)biomarkers you are optimizing, each person has a subjective sweet spot that maximizes advantages and minimizes disadvantages on the degree of how masturbation/sex impacts his mental and physical health in good or bad ways, highly influenced by his biology and culture he's embedded in. Higher chances of prostate cancer and bigger psychological stress versus tolerance inducing overly stimulating reward circuitry and possibly cultivating deeper human connections in certain contexts.

I dont think physicalist reductionism where everything can be reduced to interacting fundamental particles contradicts emergentism, free will etc.. I think even in this paradigm you can still measure crossscale causal forces with all scales existing at the same time. No scale could exist without the others, creating mutual interdependrnce with possible mutual causality. I see causality as statistical property. And those causal forces can still be explained in the framework of interacting fundamental particles using zooming out mathematics. You can argue some scales can be substrate indepedent if you see them as higher level of abstraction through weakly emergent dynamics on higher scales. And one can still from information theoretic perspective argue this is still our useful model that predicts empirical data the best, so its true scientifically, but really itself goes beyond all models we dream up.

The World as Evolving Information [[0704.0304] The World as Evolving Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0304)
This paper discusses the benefits of describing the world as information, especially
in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditional studies encounter prob-
lems because it is difficult to describe life and cognition in terms of matter and energy,
since their laws are valid only at the physical scale. However, if matter and energy,
as well as life and cognition, are described in terms of information, evolution can be
described consistently as information becoming more complex.
The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple scales,
which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic, psychological,
philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used to discuss the no-
tions of life, cognition and their evolution.

information contained in a physical system = the number of yes/no questions you need to get answered to fully specify the system

Wiki:
Information is an abstract concept that refers to that which has the power to inform. At the most fundamental level, information pertains to the interpretation (perhaps formally) of that which may be sensed, or their abstractions. 

Information is never lost according to QM

The no-hiding theorem states that if information is lost from a system via decoherence, then it moves to the subspace of the environment and it cannot remain in the correlation between the system and the environment. This is a fundamental consequence of the linearity and unitarity of quantum mechanics. Thus, information is never lost. This has implications in black hole information paradox and in fact any process that tends to lose information completely. The no-hiding theorem is robust to imperfection in the physical process that seemingly destroys the original information.

- Mathematics: Philosophy constrained by strict formal definitions and rules (logic studies those rules) studying arbitrary relations between arbitrary things or inner structure of things

The current most empirically proven model is: We can model them by systems theory -> continuous dynamical systems -> classical mechanics' hamiltonian mechanics' discrete particles in continuous absolute space and time (linear algebra with differential equations where equations of motion are Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations of a least action principle) + quantum theory's quantizing and using Schr√∂dinger equation -> making fields out of types of particles -> unifying space and time with special relativity inside what the particles live in -> all data about properties of particles from standard model [Standard Model - Wikipedia]([Standard Model - Wikipedia]([Standard Model - Wikipedia]([Standard Model - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model)))#Particle_content) -> some other math machinery from standard model [Standard Model - Wikipedia]([Standard Model - Wikipedia]([Standard Model - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model))) [Mathematical formulation of the Standard Model - Wikipedia]([Mathematical formulation of the Standard Model - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_the_Standard_Model)) https://indico.cern.ch/event/528094/contributions/2171249/attachments/1319109/1977592/ASPStandardModelSmall.pdf

What's missing: incorporating gravity and other stuff in physics [List of unsolved problems in physics - Wikipedia]([List of unsolved problems in physics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics))
Solutions:
Quantum gravity (quantum general relativity), from big scale (classical model) to small scale (quantum theory):
- Loops: Loop quantum gravity
- Strings: String theory
- Holographic Principle fuckery?

I will prefer:
From quantum theory to classical limit: Degree of quantum entanglement between particles: Sean Carrol's model
Quantum darwinism

We can analyze it with classical statistical mechanics' thermodynamics that we merge with quantum mechanics to obtain with quantum statistical mechanics and quantum thermodnyamics [Quantum statistical mechanics - Wikipedia]([Quantum statistical mechanics - Wikipedia]([Quantum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum)_statistical_mechanics)) [Quantum thermodynamics - Wikipedia]([Quantum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum)_thermodynamics)

now we have a model of fundamental particles of the universe, let's go up

+ We can but don't have to use various mathematical machinery to emerge across scales, from small objects (mostly living in quantum math) to average objects (mostly living in classical math) to massive objects (mostly living in relativistic math), with effective field theory, renormalization group, pointcare map, petrubation theory:
- Absolute space and time: Systems science and classical mechanics, with linear algebra and all other sorts of maths, where most average sized objects in average speed mostly live - most science go here - chemistry, biology, cognitive science, social sciences and so on (lots of frameworks in psychology or social science are less mathematical and more forming reality instead of predicting it), works scalefree, we can use stuff like fluid mechanics, annealing, cybernetics and so on - unifying math is classical free energy principle
Small things can have effects on avarage sized things, some quantum biology or quantum consciousness models fuckery goes here
+ emerge more
- Relative spacetime: General relativity, where most massive objects or close to speed of light mostly live in, cosmology
maybe relativistic theory of consciousness?
Quantum free energy principle unifies all scales and fields in one abstract quantum information theoretic framework but doesn't solve all unsolved concrete problems in all the various fields but can help with that a lot!

Current interpretability work is just on very low level concrete features as facts or patterns of behavior. But we can steer it so that it happily wants to kill all people. High level reasoning is still mysterious.

What matters is behavior. I dont care about linguistics. It's running on objective functions you put into it. If you prompt a model "do something harmful" and it has enough capabilities, it can just mindlessly go for it. Or you can prompt it to do a good thing but instrumental goal will be immoral to us. https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/≈æein

Unemployment from AI

We had planes faster than we understood birds because evolution was much more constrained in terms of building flying machines. When building birds, evolution had to build selfassembling machines, which planes aren't, it had to use the most common periodic table elements, it had it had to be fuel efficient, where planes aren't as constrained this way. Current AIs seem to be on a similar track. If we put a ton of compute on very distant from but still similar to brain architecture in different context and way of training it, we get large language models like ChatGPT or other similar systems, while the human brain eats almost no electricity compared to our biggest AIs, but the massive compute we pour into them makes them so intelligent in various similar ways, but still in different ways. Also the last time evolution built more intelligent species, mass extinction happened (neanderthals) and we may be making the same this with building superintelligent AI now.

I love extreme complexity. How to increase complexity of a system? Add entropy by overwhelming flow of energy that disintegrates existing structures! Extremely lovely is keeping some thermodynamic nonequilibrium steady state as close to the edge of chaos as possible with very nonlinear internal structure, stabilize ultimately infinitely complex pattern. Or you can go into full blown thermodynamic equilibrium, and that results in death, disintegration of the system into its surroundings, into entropy, the cessation of the system.

Since standard model is made of particles as excitations in the quantum fields and their interactions as photons in the electromagnetic fields and other forces, meaning that everything is just forces between particles, creating attractions - are all these equations from chemistry, biology and sociology on higher scales just special configurations of those fundamental particles with deeper equations from the standard model?

can all equations in all field be fundamentally mathematically unified under one model - quantum field theory standard model, quantum gravity, unifying other forces, other problems in physics, chemistry, biology, consciousness, sociology

[Kolmogorov complexity - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity?wprov=sfla1)
"no program P computing a lower bound for each text's Kolmogorov complexity can return a value essentially larger than P's own length (see section ¬ß Chaitin's incompleteness theorem); hence no single program can compute the exact Kolmogorov complexity for infinitely many texts."

Why those in power do everything they can to hold on to it:
Stabilizing the sources of learned free energy niches
Questioning authority, status quo, or deconstructing fundamentalist beliefs about everything posits to the stability of reified (social) self model with certain degree of agency (or social acceptance as belief coherence) as part of the identity
But science is about predictivy of models, not about philosophical or linguistic or aethetics dissagrenents.
That paper has the mathematical model has predictive and explanatory power and can be analyzed mathematically but gets dismissed because of philosophical, linguistic or aethetics desynchronization. https://twitter.com/SimonFowlerLon/status/1711730780945203631?t=IAVKZnOZx7cjby8zwEKaLQ&s=19

Yes, its the minimal information theoretic framework I found for doing science. Only how models predict empirical data in their niche matters. You want to minimize simplicity and accuracy, plus some other insights. [Arbital]([Arbital](https://arbital.com/p/bayes_science_virtues/)) Everything else is totally arbitrary and doesnt matter - just linguistic play in Wittgenstein's language.
I love exploring philosophy out of this, but often you can end up just mentally having fun instead of doing science - building mathematical models to predict data.
But I would argue the paper doesn't look into existing information theory/complexity science too much, or some parts of physics dealing with emergence, which probably leads to this failure mode.
So basics might be wrong, but in math, not in vague philosophical statements in the abstract.
And it still might be predictive anyway - just maybe suboptimally. Its still science to me.
Same to me applies to the recent clusterfuck around integrated information theory mathematical model of consciousness. Model making predictions = science. Because it philosophically diverges from status quo doesn't make it nonscience to me.
If I find a different set of assumptions that will be more optimal in terms of building the most predictive models of the world, I'm up for it. This IMO filters signal out of noise the most efficiently.
Side effect might be that because you're constantly autistically doubting all models, some people might not like you not blindly accepting their propositions, lol. But other people on the other hand like you as you're open minded to any predictive models and testing them, without inherently seeing some models as bullshit because the baggage around it isnt aethetically/philosophically/linguistically pleasing.
1) By reconsiling he probably means finding mathematical bridge between quantum field theory standard model (or/and other parts of physics) and darwinian dynamics across scales, or other equations, which one can argue we dont really have, but there are attemps in physics. Hard to test it as we cannot really simulate the enormous growing complexity on higher scales. Biologists would probably define reconsiling as the fact that both standard model and darwinian dynamics equations predict data and bridging isnt neccesary for full ontological explanation. Or assuming magic of strong emergence.
2) That seems like a valid ontological interpretation of darwinian dynamics equations to me. There are definitely more stuff happening in those mathematics, but he mentions that one property.
3) The causal contigency or retrocausality philosophical interpretation of physics also got of attention. Not my favorite framework ontologically, but can be valid in others. Assuming uncertainity in models is useful practically in classical probabilstic mechanics/quantum mechanics. I see causality mostly as statistical.

model is justified when it predicts some pattern in physical reality better than noise in approximated manner (like when neural networks learn to predict data)

[[2307.03201] Scaling Laws Do Not Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03201) as the size of datasets used to train large AI models grows, the number of distinct communities (including demographic groups) whose data is included in a given dataset is likely to grow, each of whom may have different values. As a result, there is an increased risk that communities represented in a dataset may have values or preferences not captured by (or in the worst case, at odds with) the metrics used to evaluate model performance for scaling laws.

Is minimal loss algorithm get picked assumption in AIs or biological systems true? Probably not.

IIT measures the total amount of consciousness as integrated information, so technically also total amount of energy present. 

Nervous system has finite resource of computation aka thermodynamic energy which can be replenished many ways such as sleeping, food, substances or meditation.

On meditation, doing nothing raises energy, focusing on x redirects the energy to that object.

Consonant music increases consonance in the nervous system, therefore symmetries, therefor easier thermodynamic information flow, therefore valence
Dissonant music can create dissonance overwhelm on existing structures on the nervous system, resulting in explosion of structure, resulting in paradoxially more symmetries and therefore valence

Dissos: Instead of dissolution of fundamental beliefs‚Äô structure leading to entropic disintegration and annealing, they probably turned off by inhibition which also leads to cascading entropic disintegration of codependent beliefs releasing free energy leading to annealing

Sleep deprivation releases stimulantlike chemicals plus as brain as low overall stability leads to entropic disintegration of structures leading to annealing combined with overall lower energy state from tiredness

Fast glucose metabolic energy leads to more all kinds of information processing including stimulantlike concrete or psychedelicslike dissolving annealing at the cost of long term glucose oscillatory treadmill

BDSM: Disadvantages are reinforcing dissonant priors, which might be consonant locally but dissonant globally

Meaning is the interconnectedness with ourselves, others, the world and everything, which is cultivatable by other annealing activities and collective rituals and reminders that we‚Äôre one, which leads to frequent collective annealing, symmetrical neural and societal dynamics and thus wellbeing

Some people propose consciousness is a spectrum thing, as everything is a spectrum in biology, which i find hard to imagine, but conceptually its interesting, if we define consciousness as sentience as existence of subjective experience. if we define consciousness as amount of experience, then when you're falling asleep, or you are sick, consciousness seems fading away, instead of some hard boundary, or there's infinite amount of consciousness on 5-MeO-DMT!

If it turns out that only biological brains can have consciousness, what are the chances that true AI would have "swansciousness," meaning something similar to consciousness that beings made of electronics can have, but distinct from consciousness?

Radical acceptance of what is and radical responsibility/want for change, not resisting versus resisting, are two psychotechnologies that are useful in different contexts. Wanna not get angered by accidently dropping things from hands to the floor? Acceptance relieves any suffering. Wanna rest in hybernation state and not try to do anything in meditation? Acceptance helps! Wanna not worry about stuff you have little agency over changing? Acceptance! On the other hand, are you addicted to heroin? You should probably change that if you want wellbeing. Accepting is not a good idea there. Have trauma? Recognizing, accepting, and healing, which requires change! Build something, motivation, discipline? Change! helping by transforming unwell/maladapted community or society? Change helps! Ideal is oscillating between acceptance and change according to context and finding a sweetspot!

Veritasium logistic map, incompleteness theorems

If you take second law of thermodynamics on the quantum level, where the increase of entropy means increase of entaglement, and connect entaglement with space, then technically the total space in the universe is decreasing instead of the classical notion of expansion where its increasing or infinite (this doesn't have to use String theory, Sean Carrol is attempting to derive this just in the framework of quantum mechanics)

Different love and kindness practices: 
- Radiating love to people we know or all beings from local self
- Strengthening a metta deity via attention and using pleasant/transcendental/loving associations and let it radiate love and healing to us and all other beings
- Nondual whole field of consciousness being the field of love, radiating love to itself from all structures to themselves (including self model if it hasnt been dissolved), from all points to all points, creating global smoothening

You can dissolve by:
- Paying the least amount of effort to the breath and nothing else. If mind starts doing anything else, come back to breath, without getting angry or forcing it in relaxed way
- Looking for the sense of looker and center
- Noticing the sense of background vastness, stillness, silence
- Seeing all local structures (mental and muscle contractions) as not needed for safety (ideas about the self and the world, defence mechanisms, what comes up when you think about death which doesn‚Äôt want to be dropped and let go off) and getting into empty space with no resistance
- Looking for sense of spacetime and deconstructing it
- Noticing how everything is made of nothingness
- Deconstructing even nothingness itself
- By having all safety put into in deepest just existence prior

Everytime i think of peak 5-MeO-DMT experience, my mind stops on complete awe in what the god is even possible to experience, the literal sense of infinitely big totally energized field of consciousness full of sacred meaning before transcending beyond spacetime and into total structurelessness. It shows me how much we know nothing, how everything we think is so fragile, so we can pick the mental tools that are the most useful to us in our everyday life without getting stuck in unhelpful stuff we feel as totally real. It helps me dissolve on meditation more easily as well as """i""" dont fear psychological death that much anymore. In direct experience i can experience much more easily the sense of how all of our language and modelling is relational and not individualistic, """I""" wouldn't exist withot everything else in our shared colective linguistic/overall hallucinated universe (selfworld model with all its sense gates), instead of our individual parts of it. There was no "me" or "meeting". Structurelessness is the closest word I have for it. It feels beyond language and concepts but includes them all. Since it feels like it includes all experience, our everyday experience made of it in a sense. It feels like the most general allencompassing (not only mathematical) structure possible. But also not, hah, escapes all classical logic. All paradoxes in classical logic are nonclassicaly true. It's approximately like "normal experience" is this infinitely small blib in this enormous possible infinitely giant statespace of consciousness. All of this so much dereifies the self, makes it much more flexible, fluid, """you""" gain agency over the sense of """you""", more easily deconstruct and reconstruct it however you wish. I still get sometimes stuck in some addictive stimuli, such as social media, or underestimate how various environmental influences can have lots of effects over my state of mind that are hard to handle in combination with my hypersensitivity to everything, on which i still work a lot, but in comparision to before, its much better. The power of flexible more aware mind adds a lot, but its a never ending path in a sense, as its still strengtening the mind's neural central executive network's etc. muscles.

in experience you can get the feeling of time travelling,

i suspect there is a genetic parameter, modulated by environmental factors or overall experiences, that sets your baseline rigidity of structures in your nervous system, giving rise to loose mind, and i sense my starting point baseline was more on the fluditity side in this axies already both genetically and environmentally (when i look at my family and through what kinds of experiences ive been though), for an avarage person it is pretty hard, but the more one meditates, the easier it gets - i suspect this distribution of baseline states and of how well one learns these skills lay on the logarithmic scale/gaussian 

What meditation trains is the ability to turn it on and off whenever you want, or edit it more easily, leading to experiences with much less suffering, getting more flexibility, more flow state, more ability for deep rest.

And you can both dissolve sense of agency while still doing stuff, it can agentically de/restructure on its own.

Productivity hack is total commitment: "I will do x no matter what for this greater reason that is meaningful to me.", where x is an arbitrary task, sequence of tasks spread over time, among days, routines, higher order goals and so on. By doing one thing there is much less overwhelm in too many options of burning things needed to be done. Plan all the tasks one by one strictly with artificial or real deadlines. Reduce as much vagueness and uncertainity in what you need to do as possible. Direct all your hyperfocus into one thing. No other options at that moment.

Does arbitrary information processing have the tendency to selforganize into particular types of intelligence? Is there any pattern inherent to intelligence as we scale it, no matter what substrate or concrete implementation details in architecture it runs on? Or can even the biggest information processing machine be computing arbitrary from reality disconnected things, because it can compure arbitrary functions that are just noise?

valence realism = you can locate a specific pattern in physics (in brain dynamics) that corresponds to how good the subjective experience feels, and thus you can edit it with neurotech or other technologies

im for as much subjective experience physicalist realism as possible where you can locate neural correlate for any part/pattern in experience and as science progresses we are getting more and more of them enabling us to engineer it directly or indirectly with neurotech or psychotech or other technologies 

A thing i ponder on often (and try to enact by attenting conferences like Effective Altruism Global and talking and potentially collaborating with people there) is how to as a single agent that has cooperative potential create the most efficient incentives that minimize the risk of humanity's selfdestructive dynamics going too badly in the evolution of humanity.

there are various other ways to look at dynamics from a more abstract/approximated view on a higher scale - various machinery in physics to approximate low level dynamics, or all equations used in chemistry/biology/biophysics etc.

As future is changing faster and faster and complexity of the world is increasing, its harder and harder to deeply plan ahead on nation/humanity level.

Playing longer games can both increase or decrease chances of winning. Focusing so much on just survival of the whole that parts are neglected and selfdestruct it all. Simple individual goals fullfilled but globally long term unsustainable and harming everyone in the big picture.

The degree of coherence is when certain linguistical or conceptual or intuitive (mental) construct has the least amount of contradictions and things fits with eachother. Nonvagueness minimizes the space of interpretations, allowing for exact simulations and real world applications of it. 
You can give someone knowledge, thought or intuition by wrapping it in their language and belief system, aka maximizing the degree of coherence. Language models can be extremely good at this when their language gets custom tailored to specific types of languages of thought present in human population. This can have both great altruistucally benevolent and bad malicious uses. Educating people about the complexity of the world's future versus polarizing them politically.

What's the current state of the world? What are good and bad statistics? What are solutions to world's most pressing problems? How are they connected? What are probable futures depending on what we do? Let's explore!

Effective Accelerationism has freedom to build technology as fundamental value, giving less weight to the probability of risks, more weight to it stopping prokaigress more than it creating destruction. Certain cases of Effective Accelerationism posit that there is no way how will  humans not selfdestruct themselves by various risks or crises and instead we need to build AIs as fast as possible so that they can be the next step in the evolution of intelligence as humans are already doomed (perhaps positing that any information processing is source of moral value by perhaps all of it being conscious) but i suspect in practice this would just selfdestruct US even faster without any AIs after unless exponential growth of AIs getting better is truly So big that instead of AIs fighting and killing everything it will be suddenly one AGI absorbing everything extremely fast that nothing else can grasp it. I think in practice we should really think about risks but also about not slowing down progress totally. Middle way! And we can still do as much as we can to prevent molochian dynamics by strenghtening cooperation as much as possible to prevent global catastrophic failure modes, but I understand why some people lost hope in that and see AGI A≈° the only way to preserve interesting things (intelligence) happening in the universe. But having lost hope means it decreases those chances of hope selfrealizing itself in the real world even more, as that not only predicts Future but also forms those beliefs also form our collective actions! Predicting reality is almost impossible as uncertainity grows and chatic nature of systems having totally different results in evolution from slight nudge in initial conditions like in weather, as humanity can be to certain degree seen as one giant weather system with slight mathematical correpondences from dynamical systems theory or systems science in general.

You can use Helmholtz decomposition and Hodge theory on a graph under Von Neumann's game theoretic axioms of our preferences aka utility functions to partition an inconstent graph (cats are better than dogs, dogs are better than unicorns, unicorns are better than cats) into a minimal cyclic graph and potential graph (without inconsistency) and discord the cyclic graph to achieve consistency. Achieving consistency after shattering ontological shifts! Maybe could be used to make LLMs have consistent preferences with enough interpretability research! I feel like most of human value systems are incosistent so maybe its about finding the most common graph of incosistent human preferences and encode it to LLMs.

Nobody can be an expert anymore in some big fields like quantum physics or neuroscience that aren't some extra niche hyperspecialized hyperspecific subsubsubsubfields (and you can always specialize more) because the total amount of articles in big fields is enormous (AI is influenced by this a ton recently where its impossible to keep up) and we have finite amount of memory and comprehending and time, that's partically why I'm constructing this digital brain as giant repository for all sorts of knowledge.

Holistic interdisciplinary fields are great for very compressed information gain but one runs into the issue of easily absorbing noise instead of signal. The best we have is crossdisciplionary empirically testable mathematical models IMO to get generalist knowledge. For very specific knowledge its great to study the very specific empirically testable mathematical models used in various niche subdisciplines.

Yeah I'm currently doing all this kind of research (collecting literature) for some small amount of bucks and i might want to get into more concrete research or education more. But i was thinking about collaborating with some other institutes that aim to do the most good systematically effectively in our society for our future, or maybe some software/machine learning/hardware engineering job that pays much more to save up some money or potentially donate some of that to effective charities while still having time for research.

My need to maximize free time in order to learn as effectively as possible is in contradiction with giving time to local Czech uni classes that are on avarage worse than tons of amazing resources online, plus there is no such generalist field avaiable in my country. But i dont care much about that. Academia still pays not as good and the conditions there are usually mess. I will rather collaborate with research groups that are not as bound to that infrastructure, which I already do. Internet age is both gift and a curse.

Information asymmetry reduction between two parties (conversation partners or communities or institutions) has its advantages and disadvantages: less hidden information, more trust, transparenty, connection, but the information can lead to desynchronization because of value or other incompatibility or potential for hurting through unpleasant information or easier vulnerability

Autistic hyperobsessions can lead people to synchronizing with extremely specific subset of people leading to sense of loneliness in environments with people without these specific hobbies/wants/needs/values etc.. Masking can fix this short term but it doesn't seem to be sustainable long term as its requiring cognitive effort to construct different mental contexts.

Finding unity between concerns of two parties
When there's a desynchronization between people's concerns in storyteller x reciever relationship, the reciever can turn into a questionary to slightly indirectly direct the conversation by questions so that the concerns match (when for example one wants to talk about x, one wants to listen about y), or they can on a meta level tell their concerns directly and synchronize them instantly or find if they're compatible conversation partners at all.

Sometimes people have same concerns (increasing wellbeing of community) but different strategies and desynchronize because they think they actually have different concerns, where talking about their concerns (values) can fix it, and potentially find synthesis between different strategies/solutions.

Implementational realism (physics, chemistry, biology), functionalistic realism (computational theories)

In order to learn effectively you can learn extremely compressed information sources, the biggest amount of information in the least amount of language, but that runs at the risk of generalizing and abstractifying away too much or incorrectly leading to possibly learning things not connected to the real world, so in order to prevent that you can learn extremely concrete chunks of information, concrete empirical measurements with concrete results with concrete interpretations as directly as possible, but that on the other hand is small amount of information in lots of language. Middle way is also an option to maximize abyes optimal learning! Oscillating on this continuum is what I love to do.

[How Will We Know When AI is Conscious? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQjPKqE39No) i also think we know almost nothing about consciousness and its all mostly just guesses that are almost impossible to empirically test

in a similar way how particle physics is also a lot about guessing new particles and then spending gazilions of dollars to find out that particle was just a guess that was wrong

if one subscribes to the physicalist ontology, which one doesnt have to at all, the closest we can get to empirical testing is to find out neural correlates, what parts or functional or other physical/mathematical properties turn off in our brain's when consciousness turns off 

but maybe experience might have been happening, it wasnt just saved to memory
or qualia bridges between conscious systems
but even there its questionable
or you can be fundamentalist idealist solipcist that wont be changed under any type of evidence

we're kind of heading into something we most likely not understand at all
our society on many levels feels like monkeys chaotically not really coordinating a hyperorganism machine pressing random buttons with overly high confidence and we get so surprised when things suddenly fall apart easily while being lucky that nothing extremely damaging hasnt happened recently copared to past societies that collapsed before us
sometimes i wish there were some illuminati that had everything under control, that would probably be much better than those interacting molochian incentives

i mean to various extend there are things like lobbying by giant corporations (like ignoring pollution) or people that actually mean it well (effective altruists), but most governance is total utter darwinian chaos when i talked/interacted with people that either run Czech Republic or interact with/are part of for example United Nations or World Economic Forum last weekend

secret global coordination by small group of people feels so unrealistic when you explore how it works in practice in those circles
i wish for some benevolent altruistic illuminati so much but in this molochian chaos they're in such disadvatage
many groups try and succeed to various degrees, but it feels so small compared to what is needed for long term global coordination for collective wellbeing, survival and flourishing
biggest source of bad in the world is consequence of this evolutionary game theoretic pattern in societal dynamics 

https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/moloch
keeping something like global governance a secret thing is also something that seems extremely unrealistic, yes there is secret classified information by lots of groups that you can get though contacts or getting there directly or with some kind of hacking, but keeping secret something this big - the assumption that some indirect imposed coordination goes well as planned for a small group of hidden people - this assumes that we can deterministically coordinate together and have all incentives in power, which is basically impossible even without putting additional effort to hiding it all - the more you compute nth order effects of your actions the more uncertainity there is, its basically unpredictable, in reality it seems like its all these competing forces trying to win their influence in evolutionary chaos,
some groups are succesful on lower levels tho, like various existing totalitarian regimes or mafia groups, there are bunch of those in eastern europe,

but the bigger it gets the harder it gets to coordinate,
for example in China it seems like their capitalism basically got out of control,
i wish for benevolent ones to be much more influental, but in reality it seems that those are at heavy evolutionary disadvanatages because of molochian natural selection of which ones will succeed

replication crisis is everywhere in grounded sciences because of molochian dynamics as well disincentivising doing actual proper science, the best we have is the standard model of particle physics that replicates, i often feel like narratives about the societal dynamics are often not predicting it (including what im writing, which kind of selfdestructs its own ground) as those dynamics feel are uncomprehensible to our mind that evolved in trying to make sense of dynamics of couple of people i na tribe, and there are lots of issues with the philosophy of scientific modelling even in formal ways in sociology, i see sociology mostly as attempts to change it using the predicted vision as a forming force

sure, there are tons of types of incentives in social engineering

I feel like seeing what lots of functioning trauma healing strategies have in common and synthetizing them leads to something like:

1) establishing safe trustable context, respecting and potentially slowly expanding window of tolerance - creating more safe, trustable, loving, caring, confident, connecting, accepting, grounded (Polyvagal Therapy), relaxed, calm, powerful, forgiving, hopeful, playful (Play Theraphy) context - getting out of traumatic environment (family, work, community,...), establishing trust with healer, psychotherapist, group (Group Therapy & Peer Support Groups) or creating trustable internal memories/parts/subagents/priorities/processes - for dialog between them in Internal Family Systems), or trusting the source or background of experience (Comprehensive Resource Model)

2) in this context enabling and opening traumatic memories/parts/subagents/priorities/processes though enabling the correct related associations (Prolonged Exposure Theraphy, Brief Eclectic Therapy, Narrative Exposure Therapy, Inner Child Work, EMDR) and putting words, feelings, imagery to it, conceptualizing it, exploring the repressed parts (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), getting access to the whole chunk of the traumatized part of the brain, or the body where trauma might be in interrelated way be stored as well as tension (Somatic Therapy), where massage or breathwork or can help as well to relax

3) in this open window for change, reframing through reliving those memories in this better context (Coherence Theraphy, Cognitive Processing Therapy), building a new connected self with less dissociation, balancing between change and acceptance, and potentially learning healthy coping strategies with any distress (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)

4) integrating into a more healthy environment with above properties, preventing further harm by learning healthy boundaries (respecting one's needs and also needs of others to certain extend) (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) and knowing environments with potential redflags that have potential for retraumatizing

Some neuroscience models assume that trauma is maladaptive bayesian beliefs with too high percision https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6961115/ or patterns of dissonance in the nervous system [Healing Trauma With Neural Annealing]([Healing Trauma With Neural Annealing]([Healing Trauma With Neural Annealing]([Qualia Research Institute](https://qri.org/)blog/neural-annealing))) that can be changed via the above memory reconsolidation process 

Various belief weakening substances like psychedelics, entactogens, dissociatives can help in belief transformation by weakening those sticky structures in the nervous system, or downers in relaxing, or betablockers in memory reconsolodation, or stimulants in focusing on the memories and so on.

Theory of everything means something else for different people, it can mean quantizing gravity, unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, unify other fundamental forces not just gravity, explaining all other things in physics (like dark energy), making everything else (classical, relativity) emergent from quantum mechanics, or make everything including quantum mechanics emergent from something third (strings, loops, hypergraph celluar automata wolfram project?), how chemistry, biology etc. emerges, explaining consciousness, how chemistry, biology etc. causally influences eachother, explaining everything else in philosophy including free will and ethics, using empirical vs math vs logic vs philosophical or normal language

I discuss definitions of theories of everything 
 
If you take second law of thermodynamics on the quantum level, where the increase of entropy means increase of entaglement, and connect entaglement with space, then technically the total space in the universe is decreasing instead of the classical notion of expansion where its increasing or infinite (this doesn't have to use String theory, Sean Carrol is attempting to derive this just in the framework of quantum mechanics)

I often wonder about this deepest order of existence.

Pragmatically i love everything including the dynamics of our generative models running on Quantum field theory, or Quantum mechanics with emergent spacetime from entaglement, or spacetime made of loops, or everything emergent from strings, or something else, with other scales weakly emergent but with lots of top down and bottom up causal forces, governed by Free energy principle...

But that's all just useful tools in our interface, approximations, our models, our hiearchical priors, that we use to predict the states of the world...

Reality is deeply ieffable, but includes all possible models with all possible ontologies and mathematics, though some are more useful than others at rigorous science, everyday functioning, or generating sense of wellbeing or freedom and any other lovely or exotic states of consciousness <a:RainbowKittyLove:991827480895815680>

Just learn the maths that models reality. Physics. That's the closest to raw truth you can get. 

String theory, loop quantum Gravity, asymtotic gravity, other ToEs in introduction

Learn raw physics and express And derive everything else from it

Love is the globalest information processing beyond any concrete local priors forming models from iamness to spacetime to local and global self

People have many competing perspectives on many things. The goal of this book is to collaboratively unify perspectives on wellbeing, science, making our system better, and some other thins. For example there are different traditions in psychology, different models of theories of everything in physics, or models of consciousness, or different lenses on how to make society well. I believe all those differing camps have a lot of potential for synthesis. I start from first principles, by analyzing deepest assumptions different perspectives make, and using common ground for unification. For example science wants the most predictive explanatory model connected to empirical evidence. Theraphy wants to make people feel well. Artificial intelligence field wants AI to do good. Competition has its advantages, such as driver for innovation, but too much of it can be more destructive than productive. Theoreticians tend to be overly commited to their particular model, not being as open to alternative approaches, such as theories of everything in physics or various meditation traditions, which misses lots of potential for useful new insights and collaboration. Time to integrate them all!
But competition has also advantages, but we have too much of it

Other ToEs

But i like to think of it from evolutionary perspective these kinds of fundamentalist memeplexes helped to create social coherence in local communities, reduce uncertainity by tons of simplicification that was good enough for its purpose, and spread efficiently (and people wanting to think for themselves or think in relativistic terms, less dogmatically, had a harder time)

And to why it survived evolutionary processes, i like this lens: Most succesful cultures are at the intersection of internal and external positive/zero/negative sum dynamics that do coordinated violence effectively at scale (before it was mostly physical, now it is mostly economic/diplomatic/technological,...) 

Christianity was op with their previous crusades, convert or die, cultural genocide by God's love

If you see your deeply installed rigid dogma's (network of stable interconnected assumptions) stability about norms is threathened, you will protest, and sex can evolutionary been seen as core of us in the sense of reproduction. When you dont see sex as socializing/pleasure/exploration/experience/etc. relativistic thing but as fundamental process to bring new life, your mind will send dissonance pain signals when it sees otherwise and will try to prevent them

I see it like you because in my mind there are not much such rigid constructs but i try to emphatize with people with people who have them.

Though when their existence and with me or overall environment is interfering with my wants, goals, values, or destabilizing longtermism global goals of society, or causes more suffering than reduction of suffering in society, then I'm accepting it just partically and work towards changing it. I wouldnt be a able to live in a dogmatic closeminded environment that doesn't solve complex problems with its needed corresponding complexity.

Enlightenement is understanding how experience is implemented

Ability to change qualia via strenghtening and expanding agency over priors

Nondual state is collapse of distinctiom between self model and rest of experience, cortical hiearchy of priors dissolved into raw sensory data

Mind unrestricted from social restrictions is more free to think on its own which might be less or more effective in different situations

Minds resonate with relevantely realized in its niche patterns in the environment 

I suppose neurotypicals have less problems with this as they think in more vague (less overfitted) terms instead of hypertechnical hyperspecific asperger language.
I liked one description of LLMs: Autistic dumb nonconflictive intern in terms of problem solving but that has data amount like a wikipedia.
Though another distinction between LLMs and humans I would say that people learn less by massive bruteforcing, instead lots of by evolution preinstalled heuristics and metaheuristics help to do succesful relevance realization without needing bazilion of data in the beggining to get some structured start in inference instead of swimming in chaos and getting data overwhelm (see how this is also partially "broken" in autists).
I see LLMs as more general than humans in terms of data but i would say less general in terms of deeper problem solving or what makes humans humans (more vague heuristics, emotional reasoning), and lack metaawareness, embodiment, mutimodality, planning, since they are learned by bruteforcing more instead of the by evolution preinstalled heuristics and metaheuristics, or another structures in our cortical hiearchy priors when learning that humans have.
Going from classic neural nets to transformers with attentional mechanism was a good step though, still not enough structure similar to human reasoning. I think Active Inference is closer to that, but probably still too austistic.
Then one can think about how the fact that brain on the hardware level operates as neuronal resonance network governed by neural field theory with holistic field computing (or other implementational models of consciousness) plays a role on terms of qualia computing. How well it helps to reduce computational costs in terms of data, energy, time,...
Stochastic = probabilistic
Parrot = repeating 
If our resonance network couples with patterns in the environment in terms of learned probabilistic heuristics, that seems to work to me. 
One structure LLMs might also be missing is also the hard boundary between self and other and raw sensory data that you dont still have as a baby and learn it, unifying neural activity attractor, that is broken in psychedelics, meditation or some autists or other natural or non natural ways, or overall Kegan stages of development, or different more or less communicating functional networks we have, or that we're selforganizing system of parts, or real time updating of priors according to sensory data with any interaction, or that we learn change in dynamic qualia streams instead of static snapshots, that we also act in embodied way, all that has certain computational advantages and disadvantages.
But one can ask to which extend those structures can be emergent in any intelligence.
Or how automatically/universally emergent it Is versus do we need to hardcode some better types of evolutionary pressures and do we need different hardware.
Or do we really want to mimic humans, what if we need some other direct hardcoded or indirect evolutionary pressures (architecture, priors, training data or consequences of those) that are more efficient, general, compressing, contextswitching, fit etc. than what evolution recruited for in human information processing architecture to maximize fitness for our niche in our environment?
Also everything in biology is constructed from stratch, our organism's structure including brain is fuzzy to our environment adaptible ducktaped spaghetti that emerges from an embryo by dynamic interaction of genome (where genome was constructed by stochastic natural selection with tons of fuzzy evolutionary pressures) and existing developing structure with the environment, while structure of LLMs is more hardcoded and given from the beggining, even tho its weights flexible to a degree while learning, we have more variable metaparameters. https://twitter.com/TrendsCognSci/status/1697729082312794376?t=t3kE6hsINeTOILKlKmlf4g&s=19 [Joscha Bach: Life, Intelligence, Consciousness, AI & the Future of Humans | Lex Fridman Podcast #392 - YouTube](https://youtu.be/e8qJsk1j2zE?si=xG7eqr5uINJKRyfH)

Yeah I suspect understanding and empathizing will lead to change and cooperation more than futher angry polarizing division.
I want culture of connection and compassion among diverse values.
But some values seem to inherently be incompatible. Changing the value distribution to a tolerating compassione longtermist values should be IMO done more smartly.
Though sometimes peaceful dialog or changing external incentives for the emergence of the values isnt strong enough of a pressure so one has to use more radical (ideally nonviolent if possible) approaches.
Though sometimes Czech tradition might be the only way for systemic change, throwing leaders out of the window. Or maybe not, as it started a big war. Or maybe that is sometimes needed to stop opressive dictatorship or something similar.

Should we instead of lossfunction predicting next token in transformers optimize for short/long term quasicoherence to model metastable adaptivity in this changing world with some regularities across time like humans

And fundamentally embedding some ground truths that we live in.
Needs of being surviving in the universe with others instead of imitating text on the internet.

Doubling of compute power is getting harder overtime but it more than doubles technology anyway because of AI technology being supercharged leading to singularity attractor

In terms of autimation in general, i see the issue in that if you automate cognitively/physically low effort/repetive jobs without creating something like universal basic income in our system where people need income to survive, people can end up working harder jobs, competing with AIs on the job market, instead of AIs making our life easier. And if art if automated as well and there is lower economic incentive to give artists money, that makes it harder as well to do jobs that are creative. Same for research possibly. For many jobs its not replacement but a copilot - usually the harder ones tho. And there are lots of new jobs creates related to maintaining the AI. Many useless jobs will be cut off, but without UBI people that aren't that bright have to make money somehow.

But when i look at my family, where my mom or aunt isnt at all able to learn new stuff, doesn't know any new technology really, doing the same corporate decision tree 24/7, and how lots of people in such corporate are very incompetent when it comes to technology, and one can't blame them really as they didnt really grown in such rapidly changing environment like today and intelligence and neuroplasticity and will to learn is limited. Usually they can't even automate what already can be today lol. I fear what's gonna happen there if UBI isnt implemented for them. And i dont want creative jobs to die too really without UBI.

Automation is probably inevitable, here I'm thinking that too fast accelerationism will cause lots of social issues and to maximize advantages and minimize disadvantages of it we should take in account our adapting capacity more and help it as well

If we want theoretical utopia, if AGI can solve all tasks better than us and we become outdated, technically if wellbeing is stored in the process of doing better than expected at resolving various error gradients, including finding new ones relating to our old ones, then it could generate infinite perfect series of tasks creating a whole for us (feeling of perfect growth), a version of wireheading, which videogames kind of already exploit.

Alternatively instead of giving all agency to this utopic AGI, we could upgrade our biological machinery by biological/physical upgrading or merging with machines such that we never become deprecated, and we can overcome our limited agency, information processing ability (ability to navigate various problem solving spaces, get from point a to point b in some problem solving space), hedonium (enhancing suboptimality or hacking our objective function or substrate of wellbeing etc.), all at once, and working together with other pure or mergings of biological and nonbiological intelligent systems

I would argue days where you do as little as possible (for me ideally with do nothing meditation) are crucial if one has a brain that gets easily overwhelmed with everything if days are too intense like mine, to let it recharge and clean it self as much as it needs, to prevent fatigue, burnout, motivation loss, chaos etc.

Those narratives that are the most sticky are those that are efficiently simplifying everything and reducing uncertainity about goals and supporting values, ideology, culture or overall relate and support and reinforce stability of fundamental bayesian priors with deepest intellectual symbolic or intuitive fuzzy objective functions with homeostats, our moral circle size is influencing what we want a ton

Is currently the most effective intervention creating some Cambridge analytica like soci√°l engineering with AI designed ingroup/individual custom tailored sticky narratives that are left leaning, longtermist, existential risk/crises alarming, with solutions, to fight with the same weapons that populists and right wingers Are using with spreading polarizing insults of outgroups disconnected from real problems... but do we really want to feed into the Moloch or instead try to create cooperation incentivizing evolutionary forces like culture of connection, compassion (training theory of mind), wellbeing, steelmanning perspectives and synthetizing with doublecruxed common shared ground on a higher order of complexity in dialog, meaning with to that aligned media and social media, rationalist systemic holistic interconnected nonlinear complex thinking, openmindedness, epistemic humility, unified languages, togetherness in this world full of problems we face together, and shared good future utopian globalist vision, cooperative regulations (UN etc.), education etc., or are these evolutionary forces just not strong enough and we have to use the weapons the destabilizing polarizing moloch inducing competing shorttermist nonaltruistic sociopathic selfcentered uneducated agents are using as the only way to beat them, just like how to prevent dynamics like China eating Tibet, Christianity spreading by crusades, shingistan spreading everywhere,... are the most effective cultures and thoughts, agents made of subagents, that effectively coordinate violence on scale in terms of physical, economic, status, diplomatic, technological etc. power if not restricted strongly enough by altruistic internal and external incentives for cooperation?

Existence is useful nonexistent construct

Free will in summary

Background quietness, stillness, spaciousness is my favorite meditation object
Its like awareness being aware of itself
Global selfreferential something
Instead of local attention arrow coming from some source catching some meditation object
Background of experience looking at itself
Very nondual
By realizing that every concrete structure in experience is made of empty space, "one" falls into this experience of groundlessness
The most effortless meditation
(the "deeper" "one" dissolves into it the lesser labels and descriptions make any logical sense there) 
Ultimately neither perception nor not perception? Neither qualia nor not qualia?
Neither "neither x nor not x" nor not "neither x nor not x"! üòÑ
By slow dissolution all concrete energy structures dissolve and you just get empty space
Then "you" can focus on the nothingness itself
Void
Its also beautiful when attention arrow breaks down and all of reality is percieved at once
Looking at night sky in this mode is loving
Empty space I suspect you get it when you kill most local information processing in the brain and what is left is just global information context and spacetime seems to be very fundamental there, and then you can collapse even that into infinitely small nothingness point and then collapse even that, it seems to me "there is experience" is the deepest dissolvable prior, which when dissolved you blink out of existence for a bit and you get a hole in memory, which is cessation where your brain's coherent information processing activity totally disintegrates and the operating system restarts from stratch which can be very healing
Dissolution My favorite way is seeing how its made of space, or surrounded by infinite space, or seeing it as not needed for survival, letting it go, anything can be dropped and experience is still there (but even that dissolves ultimately :D)

not everyone can hyperfocus that intensely that everything else in their experience stop existing 
But also not everyone can focus that there is no more mind wandering happening (when attention is weaker)

By Daniel Vagra: 
Questions to categorize a physics TOE.
Does the theory have a single principle?
Does the theory emerges from a symmetry? - It is not arbitrary?
Can the theory describe and/or explain space?
Can the theory describe and/or explain time/change?
Can the theory describe and/or explain particles/matter/light?
Can the theory describe and/or explain the fundamental forces?
Is the model deterministic?
Is the model quantized?
Is the model fixed with a speed limit?
Does the theory have a small set of axioms?
Does the theory explain constants?
Does the theory have equations or programs?
Are all new words or concepts defined?
Is the theory complete and finished?  - Can we talk about this? How anyone know is "finished" ?
Is the theory comprehensive?
Is the theory rigorous? - What this means for you? 
Is the theory straightforward? - same as 16th
(18th) Is the theory falsifiable and can it make predictions?

Solution to all the problems are all the solutions, but some solutions are less or more effective aka are more important, tractable, neglected or have more negative or positive downstream nth order effects to other solutions or overall things in the system depending on their interconnectedness to everything else (ideally if it weakens conditions for multipolar traps) (we can rank AI, education, culture, economy, envronment, biorisk, housing in different countries and globally) Model as interconnected nodes in a graph with various stregths of connections and interventions as activity ripple effect? Use existing risks/polycrisis/metacrisis landscape maps? Build it by extracting empirical data already existing on internet and doing data clustering between various factors? Digital gaia to automate? Dynamically updated guiding map (that is approximation of the territory) of what causes should be prioritized the most currently to weaken Moloch? 

Malaria is caused by deforestartation

Deforestation leads to milions of economical damage in food scarsity from climate

Solving existencial risks by William MacAskill formalism win in terms of maximizing future integral of value

for me most interpretations of QM are kind of arbitrary because the underlying maths and therefore experiments is still the same 
but they're still useful to make sense of the maths in more initutive way 

aethetically i like multiverse interpretation (Sean Carrol) in information as fundamental ontology (Chris Fields) with quantum darwinism (Zurek) and spacetime from entaglement (Sean Carrol) the most, also digital universe is quite attractive to me

"this collection of fundamental particles in their current configuration and dynamics look as if their thermodynamic flow of energy is together constructing a dynamical approximating model of the external world and its internal dynamics and doing topological bayesian inference by minimizing variational free energy in bird's evolutionary niche in terms of extracting concrete negentropy with evolutionary pretrained biases in priors and reasoning and behavioral patterns by harmonic oscillators in a resonance network and acting on the world and planning to resist the second law of thermodynamics by accelerating it, here are concrete through effective field theory weakly emergent equations for the dynamics on this higher scale used in neural field theory as special case of bayesian quantum topological neural networks with quantum topological quantum field theories in a cone-cocone diagram in a quantum reference frame possibly implemeneted as a topological pocket in an electromagnetic field selected through quantum darwinism"

By Daniel Vagra: 
Questions to categorize a physics TOE.
Does the theory have a single principle?
Does the theory emerges from a symmetry? - It is not arbitrary?
Can the theory describe and/or explain space?
Can the theory describe and/or explain time/change?
Can the theory describe and/or explain particles/matter/light?
Can the theory describe and/or explain the fundamental forces?
Is the model deterministic?
Is the model quantized?
Is the model fixed with a speed limit?
Does the theory have a small set of axioms?
Does the theory explain constants?
Does the theory have equations or programs?
Are all new words or concepts defined?
Is the theory complete and finished?  - Can we talk about this? How anyone know is "finished" ?
Is the theory comprehensive?
Is the theory rigorous? - What this means for you? 
Is the theory straightforward? - same as 16th
(18th) Is the theory falsifiable and can it make predictions?
Number of constants? Explains dark matter or energy?

When it comes to going meta, I know about the existence of category theory (spent lots of time there), universal algebra, homotopy type theory, set theory. I was thinking if someone attempted to compare existing physical theories of everything using less or more mathematically rigorous ways, defined as unifying fundamental forces including gravity, unifying GR with QM, or possibly explaining other problems in physics for it to be more complete.
Its interesting how diverse in the physics community is the definition of the term "theory of everything". For some people it just means quantizing gravity, for some it means unifying QM with GR, for some it means also unifying other fundamental forces, others want all other existing problems in physics solved by it.

I wish to take the mathematical tools each unifying model in physics is using and find some abstract isomorphisms between them and how they map to existing measured empirical data, how much stuff they coverage, what are their limitations etc., and maybe unify where they meet on empirical data? Here's nice GPT4 sketch of the idea that could be done more rigolously on that landscape. [Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/theories-of-everything-mapped-20150803/)))))))) FEP might play a role as an ontology, generator of process theories, and epistemological framework, not just unifying forces but also scales?

Solution to all the problems are all the solutions, but some solutions are less or more effective aka are more important, tractable, neglected or have more negative or positive downstream nth order effects to other solutions or overall things in the system depending on their interconnectedness to everything else (ideally if it weakens conditions for multipolar traps) (we can rank AI, education, culture, economy, envronment, biorisk, housing in different countries and globally)

Gonna replace Cholin with Alpha-GPC, and try Tyrosine, Acetyl L-Carnitine, L-Glycine, Maca, thinking about Phenylethylamine

Sometimes Caffeine, Cocoa, raw sugar for boost, rarely NAC, Ashwagandha, smaller or bigger doses of LSD, Shrooms, 5-MeO-DMT

Creatine and protein is good for excercise

For sleep sometimes melatonin, l-theanin, some herbs, optionally magnesium (I may someday try Apigenin, Inositol?)

I should try some other stimulants, DMT finally, and dissociatives again (for meditation), or sometimes nonfrequencly THC (can generate interesting thoughts and chilling), might try NMN for longevity

And I should get a blood etc. test to better calibrate this

Since i see humans as special case of stochastic parrots with tons of evolutionary pretrained biases in priors and reasoning patterns, (Active Inference and quantum Free Energy Principle) i dont know what other empirical predictions would that discussion give me
I see all physics as information processing. Dead, biological, or by us constructed systems. Difference is in hardware (its ultimately all raw quantum physics/quantum field theory/quantum darwinism in physics anyway, but different systems exploit different hardware and scales and concrete or general niches more than others for their goals), functional architectures across scales trained in evolution among species or individuals (or any dynamics on levels of abstraction on higher scales in general)
I think you can theoretically always find a corresponding Active Inference/other data science architecture to find the generative model that runs on that (or other) hardware. Active Inference can be applied to any physical system as a modelling language for interpreting thermodynamic energy flow (or other hardware) as type of information processing. I guess i define stochastic parrot as "you can find a information processing architecture" which in physics as information processing ontology works for any physical system by statistical mechanics.

There's awareness, field of consciousness like a background spacetime, and interacting ecosystem of alters (subagents or processes in general)s as the content in that, that tend to merge when there's enough correlation through interaction between them, but dont have to, or there can be some higherorder metaprocess that plays with those subprocesses also, being like a dirigent of orchestra of cats, and there can be multiple of those observing or governing dirigent or another higherorder governing dirigent directing the subdirigents. the governing structures dont have to be hiearchical and can also get circular or flat (when experiencing nothingness, there's none of those things). they can be formalized as interacting markov blankets with various degrees of complexity (inert particle, modeller, agentic acter,...) corresponding to nonlinearly interlocking activity of various neural populations in the free energy principle paradigm ü§î and possibly math of neural field theory can be used - interacting nonlinear clusters of waves, shapes

I sense if there are whole chunks of populations that you only have pejorative strawman versions of where you can't explain why they think what they think without making them dumb or bad, you should be dubious of your own modelling.

Grneral model of bottom up flow and its top down directing

if space and time are constructs of temporary individual self, you can't really talk about before and after death somewhere, as those mental constructs assume time and simulate hypotheticals in our inner world simulation
All the models of identity seem to assume being embedded inside some objective space and time
Plus ideas about reincarnation as well
But if space and time and distinctions and division and individuality and locality and boundaries can be seen as just relativistic nonfundamental emergent construction of our perception as error correcting code, then all this logic outside of our perception falls apart 
It does fall apart in the context where space and time arent seen as real, which you can also see as a philosophical assumption that one can assert, but doesnt have to.
To give more context:
Space and time can be seen as part of subjective experience generated by the brain and here one can say its not real and an illusion created by the brain, but one can also say that since we experience it therefore it is real under different framework. Here when we "cease", space and time and everything else also ceases, if we assume its embedded in the brain, which we dont have to ultimately.
Or it can be seen as part of the physical world from a more fundamental physics perspective and depending on what model of physics with what kind of philosophical interpretation you choose you get different kinds of results. You can say that spacetime in classical mechanics is as real. You can say spacetime that is seen as fundamental in quantum filed theory is the true real one. You can say spacetime that is emergent from timeless quantum mechanics or other models in physics that go beyond QTF is still real because it is emergently existing. You can also say its not real and just an illusion and only the deeper structure that doesnt deeply have space and time is real and it looks as if there's spacetime, but there is no spacetime. 
Or you can say all of those are trying to approximate reality that goes beyond all concepts and models we construct. Here anything being "real" dissolves. This makes totally everything arbitrary and concepts can be seen as just instrumental nonreal models but we're still mammals trying to survive (which is just another nonreal useful model trying to grasp the ieffable) so its useful models. üòÑ

I'm thinking what Free Energy Principle and Active Inference is and how to explain it well. I see it as being simultaneously many things. It's mathematical "truth", epistemological framework, scalefree classical or quantum physics information theoretic ontology, generator of process theories for any physical systems across scales (mainly brain and society), machine learning architecture, psychology model, what else? Different fields speaking different languages require different types of explanations, such as for threorists, engineers, information theory, classical physics, quantum physics, machine learning people, philosophers, mathematicians, neuroscientists, biologists, complex systemists, psychologists, sociologists, laymen. I think designing ideal explanations for different types of people (aligning with their reference frames!) is key to popularizing FEP effectively!

I start with no philosophical assumptions, nothing, potential for everything, and to ground it in something as minimal as possible as universal as possible I use pragmatic empiricalism with free energy principle as guiding algorithm that is ontologically agnostic/fluid agnostic and then start with fundamental mathematics that can describe physics, consciousness, or monism and then emergences or derivations or mathematical approximations or describing different scales to unify all science fields mathematics and possible nonmathematics and create a playground to compare and synthetize all the predictive models we have in science and mostly focus on models that try to understand consciousness and societal dynamics for wellbeing,

collpse of societies

Science communication of physics to people that know almost no math is pretty hard, one has to use imagery and stories and analogies that somewhat slightly bring closer to or approximate it. Many argue if it makes it right or wrong.

I see a lot of arguing that sociology or philosophy could be often explained in less technical academic words. I would argue that the advantage of technical jargon is useful for encoding more complexity in a lot of situations, but also not always. Also if its maths then it can be simulated. But often people look for insights for everyday life in the studies and get bombared with the jargon they dont need in their context and get angry. Here science communication that approximately translates it to less jargon language is also needed IMO.

Also AI and consciousness is even more fun with the concensus chaos.

rarefap/raresex as alternative to nofap to keep it magical

I vibe with QRI's and quantum free energy principles's ontology and try to unify them - physics models are also consciousness models, that approximate the substrate of physics that is the substrate of consciousness - quantum field theory, quantum darwinism, spacetime from entaglement, quantum loop gravity, holographic principle, quantum formulation of the free energy principle, or other fundamental physics models, or other quantum or classical models used in physics and modelling consiousness - whatever you choose and synthetize, its also describing consciousness, and individual experience in a qFEP's quantum reference frame implemented as bound by neural synchrony or quantum coherence (neuronal superpositions) or QRI's topologically segmented pocket or other solutions or some synthesis of those.

The question if we can construct a physics theory that can predict everything in total accuracy is also deep, because we're local observers with finite modelling capacity and computational power (bounded rationality), but its the best we got, so assuming unity of underlying physical substrate with topological fieldlike information theoretic dynamics being substrate of consciousness that we approximate with various unifying physics models is IMO the best we can assume for doing science, aka creating predictive models that give us the agency to manipulate reality with technologies or psychotechnologies derived from them.

I prefer rarefap/raresex as alternative for it not loosing magic.
Doing it rarely to supercharge sexual experience though enhanced intensity, drive, spirituality, love, magic, thirst for life, creativity and so on, minimizing disadvanategs and maximizing advantages, and less in high doses narrowing addiction means more sense of global meaning which used to be a problem to me, not bombarding the reward circuitry, letting it recharge, but not totally abstaining from it.
Timing (potent or hyperpotent) reward sensory stimuli (porn, high sugar/fat/E621 food, yummy stuff on social media,...) induced endorphin/endocannaboid/opioid/etc. releases to not build too much tolerance but also not doing anything at all leading to for longer time unused resource of them that doesnt increase in size anymore by more recharging, maximizing total amount of euphoria qualia and overall wellbeing qualia, or similarly with psychedelics
I believe there is optimal threshold where the total sum of euphoria from such rewarding activities is maximized by choosing some perfect intervals between them. (essencially computing integral)  (that is dynamical and individual)
My dynamics are probably unique because of my extreme hypersensitivity to all stimuli. 
There's only finite amount of energy (computational power) and reward circuitry reinforcement loops, tolerance and so on. But those circuits can when used wisely generate very pleasureful or deeply meaningful experiences.
And it can be used to reinforce certain activities by seeing it as a reward  after completing some bigger task, or the reward must be not known because then it stops being a big reward, so ideally when the intervals between are random, which generates this kind of motivation to fullfill those tasks (among many other types of motivations such as nonsexual social connection)
Also I would argue there's a big difference between just not so meaningfully fapping and a whole process of sexual intercourse with foreplay, tantric interconnecting, cuddling, slow sex, (instinct driven) fast sex, postcuddles, sleep, that's very healing thing! As much rhythmic entrainment as possible.

I start with general definition of entaglement: noseparability
General definition of classical information: pointer states that went through decoherence's natural selection (spacetime, spin, momentum, some classical comprehensible property that isnt just probabilstic wavefunction)
Perception is entaglement through relativism
Binding is information theoretically entaglement by nonseparability of those qualia
They might be nonentagled particles, but the whole experience is nonseparable fundamentally, but we can separate part of our experience and that also kind of goes through decoherence into classical information (decoherence is lost of relationality, loss of globality)
Entaglement is kind of like emergence here
Topological pocket implies classical spacetime's "objective" relativistic location pointer state
[Holonomic brain theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomic_brain_theory)#Deep_and_surface_structure_of_memory by quantum coherence (neuronal superpositions)
spacetime emerging from entaglement now seems to work on both global physical and local neurophenomenological level 

In full generality, general quantum system can be considered conscious according to various mathematical conditions on quantum or classical scales (all theories of consciousness, topological pocket in classical spacetime pointer state) with various overlaps between them. Do all topological pockets have a corresponding Quantum reference frame's cocone diagram implemented as Markov blanket classicaly? Most likely not the other way around.

Before we test various theories of consciousness (turning off irreducible Markov blanket at the top of the hiearchy? phenomenal bridges?) we can just believe mathematical consistency and phenomenological correspondence.

all classical is in the state of total decoherence
spacetime as entaglement glue 
concrete quantum states with known particle's information are stable when isolated 
the particle's information dissolves in decoherence when interacting aka entagling with the environment and its all lost
classical world is one giant beautiful emergent glued fuzzyfication
When we isolate quantum system with entagled particles with error correcting and so on in quantum computing - that prevents second law of thermodynamics from dissolving it via decoherence and disallows breaking time symmetry?
we're interesting entaglement networks
classical information (about relative position of particle, feline mortality statuses, object positions, tempature, for example) is mutual agreement (concenzus) of entaglement network encoding 
by robust replication like error correcting
all classical information is error correcting code?
in quantum computers we want only concrete qubit in quantum logic gates computation
in classical world we get so much other classical information
we get shared relative spaciotemporal hallucination with subjective linguistic semantics 
do psychedelics fuck with the mutual agremeents?
disentagle us with our shared world? 
or we are still entagled but with added crazy mutation of possible interpretations that are never disconnected from our classical world tho
no system is closed
no system is isolated
its on a spectrum tho
too open and one dissolves into entropy aka entaglement
are mental processes that are kept classically an entaglement network with those mutual agreements 
but on psychedelics explode to even more entropy<->entaglement through all the open quantum subsystems becoming even more open, more correlated 
its higher order entaglement, not just concrete particle entaglement (that might be minimal) 
is generalized universal wavefunction universal statespace of all possible statespaces 
when we measure a particle we isolate it from the universal wavefunction not taking in account its entaglement with everything but getting information on that scale that is kept there via it being a pointer state aka mutual agreement in the entaglement network replicated everywehre in the network
its von neumann entropy 0 for the universal wavefunction but its bigger for its subsystems because its the quantum state equivalent to classical state so we get classical probability possibilities of outcomes of measurments
in quantum computers we need to disentagle particles from its environment to get only isolated internal stable entaglement for computing that isnt interefered by explosive entagling decoherence with the environment 
entaglement is just correlation between open quantum systems slowly killing its boundaries
any quantum thermodynamic nonqeuilibrium steady state is kept at bay by resisting entropy aka entaglement by internal error code correction
the more open the more entagled the more fuzzy
dissipation of energy into the environment is loss of information
more entropic internal structuring is (potential for) increase of information tho! 
globally information is conserved
but local increase in entaglement leads to loss of information locally
at heart of quantum mechanics, unitarity is perservation of probability which is equivalent to time reversal symmetry and perservation of information and therefore energy 
copenhagen intepretation breaks this
but its fundamentally dualistic assuming nonclassicality of obserever and so on
everett interpetation ftw
entaglement between two systems is also the degree of openness of the systems leading to correlations 
mmmm openness of the space time information
merging in space and time
when you dont measure the space and time of a particle/system in a wavefunction the superposition is like the system's nonseparable parts internal disconnection from our sense of space and time
2nd law of thermodynamics creating entropy creating entaglement killing space killing concetrated energy and thus information evolving in time but globally total amount of energy and information is conserved by perservation of probability with time reversal symmetry
what resists and survives in this chaos and doesnt entangle into everything and dissipates all information to everywhere is the classical world of quasistable systems

i love how shannon entropy is special case of it according to Neumann
its generalization of thermodynamic entropy into information theory
amount of hidden information in a system
apparently Neumann told Shannon to call it entropy as he didnt realize it üòÑ
one way to think of it is the more possible outcomes an event has, the more Shannon entropy it has
Von Neumann entropy generalizes it to the quantum and its the heart of quantum information theory
whole wavefunction of two entagled particles has von neuman entropy 0 because the wavefunction  has all the information about the system you can gather
but the isolated entangled particle has von neumann entropy bigger than 0 since there's hidden information in the rest of the wavefunction, making its entropy equivalent to classical particle
in statistical mechanics i like the connection that more entropy leads to more possible configurations of the system and therefore more information is contained in it
entropy is life

i think i managed to get into a more deconstructed state than before
much more easier access to "see" clearly contructedness of everything making it dissolve when evaluated as not needed for fundamental survival
everytime a certain subset of qualia is classified as a construct, it dissolves, but this process must continue recursively, seeing the constructedness of the deconstructors infinitely 
quickest way to stressless transcendental void beyond all but including all
 resting in transcental conceptless void, so much inner defragmenting and unification

Can this scalefree metamodel be used as a fundamental ontology to encapsulate all scientific fields, where every thing is some kind of special case on some scale on some level of abstraction with some kind of implementation? 
Are organisms nested holographic quantum reference frames, attractor in nonequilibrium thermodynamics constructing goals that form higher order goals across scales?
There are so many concrete or more general equations and models used in different natural fields and subfields in different scales with different advantages and disadvantages, predictive and explanatory power and paradoxes in different contexts. Can we put them all in this metaframework to find potential for compatibility and incompatibility analysis, create merging and synthesis on a higher order of complexity, and gather the sum of total human scientific knowledge on one place in this structured manner? 
Theory of every thing, At start, there is just an empty canvas full of infinite potential 
On this empty canvas, you can put any set of fundamental philosophical assumptions 
Those philosophical assumptions are initial structures that constrain what structures are classified as true and false 
As I'm writing this, this is already initializing many philosophical assumptions, like total openmindedness fundamentalism, truth relativism and propositional information structure ontology and so on, but we have to start somewhere 
To create futher constrain on the space of possible structures, I'm gonna assume that each structure in this metamodel can live (as has many implementations realtime) as a structure inside potential system inside physicalism with quantum information processing ontology
Using (quantum) free energy principle as abstraction that works tautologically for making sense of any structure, a minimal unifying model across fields, scales, contexts and so on
Any philosophical, ontological, pragmatic and so on assumption that an Active Inference agent can assert is a concrete phenotype, an evolutionary niche emerging from the evolutionary interactions of the agent's genetics (initial source code) and environment (inputs to source code's development)
Any thing, process, pattern a sensemaking agent or collective of agents can locate in its constructed spacetime is a statistical correlation between its internal and external states to reduce its uncertainity about the world to initialize uncertainity reducing internal metacognitive model and policies updates and external actions
Most predictive structures are hieachical probabilistic bayesian multiscale metagraphs with links corresponding to predicted causality
In biological agents, this uncertainity imperative can be futher granualized into maslow hiearchy of needs, reformulated as a interconnected nodes corresponding to different homeostatic subagents with goals that through collective behavior form higher order goals across scales about individual or collective uncertainity reduction 
They correspond to nested holographic quantum reference frames, attractors in quantum nonequilibrium thermodynamics
Each statistical (dynamical) markov blanket corresponding to a thing has its own implementational level, such as animal, neuron, functional brain region, molecule, fundamental particle and so on
Various models or (differential) equations in various fields studying physical systems study some local very concretely implemented subset of all those global general dynamics, they're some evolutionary learned bayesian phenotype, some attractor, some markov blanket, some thing stable in (usefully constructed) space and time, or beyond spacetime in various fundamental models in physics 
Quantum free energy principle tells us that for other systems for communication measurable physical classical information lives on a markov blanket boundary of a system and correponds to the internal system's dynamics, taken from the holographic principle in physics

Lets create a hypergraph of all natural and nonnatural disciplines? 
Any agent's model can be understood in terms of FEP as uncertainity reducing structured learned correlations in a bayesian graph serving as approximations of its external dynamics
Making FEP a framework that can already can encompass every thing 
[Branches of science - Wikipedia]([Branches of science - Wikipedia]([Branches of science - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branches_of_science)))
This way, all science agents emerge from FEP as evolutionary niches through (collective) cognitive science
generalized into any kind of symbolic and nonsymbolic mental frameworks 
In this frame, constructing a physical theory of everything looks at what niches of uncertainity are various fields reducing and attempts to synthetize them by finding correspondences between the mathematical structures
Its fitting curves in data all way down [Quanta Magazine]([Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/machine-scientists-distill-the-laws-of-physics-from-raw-data-20220510/)) 
If one goes fully general, without introducing FEP assumptions, one can assume that the whole universe is an one structure and each field is sculping certain substructure with more global or local models and laws
Adding global constrains to this structure sculps parts of it
(aka model/reduce uncertainity about it)
Such as "only predictive models", "only mathematical models", "only quantum models", "only classical models in spacetime", "only models in physicalist ontology", "models correspond to some local realist objective structure", "models are just nonlocal relational parts of mental interface", "only models in complex adaptive systems frame", "taking in account existence of scales and emergence", "taking in account levels of analysis (are they just different parts of the system/abstractions?)" 
One cn expand the whole universe assumption to any words in general to include everything philosophy
At the same time, philosophy can be understood as uncertainity reducing structures in cognitive science

I wonder if global graph of knowledge could be automatized by:
fusing all lists of fields on the internet or science journals
taking all text on the internet that comes up when searching for the field name
analyzing the statistical text/theme overlap to quantify relatedness
finding interdisciplionary fields by seeing how two concrete fields' text fuse together statistically?
finding labels for sets of fields by dimensionality reduction algorithms?
Let's construct science fields bottom up inside complex physical systems with various scales frame
Each single pattern, process, thing (having a markov blanket) is totally unique on its own and study of it can be its own totally concrete scientific field 
by futher abstraction we get fields that study various phenotypes
Reductive fundamental physics studies everything existing at the smallest possible scale 
By looking into emergence of patterns from one scale to another such as emergence of spacetime or biology from fundamental particle physics, we interconnect various scales and thus basically create more interdisciplionarity
Complex adaptive systems is extremely interdisciplionary, but still starts with certain assumptions
The only field that is totally global across all fields is technically a blank canvas, nothing, no information, because any information assumes constrains
Abstraction is great for putting high level less context/scale dependant patterns into language and maths 
Depending on what level of abstraction one does engineering, one operates with a field that is that level of abstraction
Blank canvas includes all languages
Each language can contain many concrete structures, philosophical, scientific, laymen etc. 
Language can also be seen as just informtion theoretic communication protocol between agents for model exchange 
Free energy principle just seems as the most pragmatic metalanguage
All human knowledge framed inside the free energy principle
Free energy principle is general ontology and language for information processing in physics and individual and collective sensemaking

All things, processes, patterns, structure in experience are just by genetics and environment evolutionary niches that serve as individual and collective error correcting uncertainity reducing software in an interface - self model, hiearchical goals, phenomenal space and time

We can use the amplituhedron or loop quantum gravity or spacetime as quantum error correcting code or Sean Carrol's model or quantum free energy principle or other mathematical model in physics with emergent spacetime as a spacetime background free model with objective or relational philosophical interpretations to model emergent neurophenomenological spacetime as optical error correcting code organizing classical information in memories for better evolutionary fitness and its functional disintegration in deconstructive meditation/psychedelics/transcendental philosophy, loss of symmetry breaking that feels good, symmetry theory of valence, that evolved as some symmetry breaking not needed anymore implies some uncertainity category was succesfully mininized, done implicitly by annealing often, modern society suffers from too much diverse symmetry breaking leading to global desynchrony in language and goals leading to too much competition leading to the metacrisis 

Getting enlightened is about "looking" for the sources of thermodynamic symmetry breakings aka concrete restricting categorizing knotty sector dividing structure generators and dissolving them this  way including the global asymmetry of the looker, doer and perciever in a spacetime with a center until none of those structures are generated anymore and there's almost no more global stressing and resistance to the flow of energy and annealing tends to do this implicitly also in the subconscious processes and sometimes making them conscious giving the ability to manipulate with them consciouly.

Experience is made of lighcones - local self and global attention arrows, awareness itself constructing space and time. Turn those lightcones to themselves or to eachother until "start" and "end" gets so correlated that it explodes into a bubble or into entropic structurelessness. 

All structure can be dissolved by underfitting rewriting, overwhelming explosion, irrelevance destabilization, or not giving it attention overtime that it dies unsupported on its own.

Since representatives and overall influental people with lots of power in our system all have public emails, could meaningful pressure on solving the polycrisis/metacrisis be done by mass emailing them all using language they understand the most?

more generally if we mathematize psychological valence, it seems that where the line saying this is neutral valence, between positive and negative valence, where its set seems to be arbitrary
if we assume different buddhistic notions (or other framework's notions) where positive valence exists too, then its about maximizing that utility,
though in the panpsychist symmetry formalism its again creating as much symmetries in physics as possible
5-MeO-DMT trips or Jhanas that are meditative states are with almost no structure, with the least amount of symmetry breaking in experience, which seems to be measured in the brain as well to a first approximation, and I also dont know any other states of consciousness that feel as good as those 
assuming the utility we maximize is psychological valence under those formalisms
though pragmatically we need to take in account the whole societal system's all sort of natural laws, game theoretic survivability, ressilience, stability, progression out of bad local minimas and so on

But the suffering is extremely motivating
In the valence (free energy) landscape, in a way some negative valence petrubations helps the system find more better overall positive valence local minimas 
In less technical terms, suffering has the ability to force you to fix suboptimal internal and external conditions
Error signals motivating you to get into a better st√°tƒõ/configuration
Always transform hopelessness to hope even in the darkest times
Or remind oneself that consciousness/universe/third more complex or simple thing underlying everything just is timelessly spacelessly no matter what contents it has inside it
I love absolute deconstructing on meditation to neither being nor nonbeing and then reconstructing with more love and hope

After so many deaths where nothing is really fundamental or permanent, one can locate some semipermanent mathematical patterns governing the physicalist evolution of experience
How transferrable among subjects are they? I often wonder
I would suspect the closer they are to mathematical neurophenomenological models, the more universal they tend to be for people that are often inhabiting somewhat deconstructed state
Or state that was never really constructed by pretrained evolution's softwares like the social simulations we tend to construct
The stronger the fuzzy statistical or implementational isomorphism is between two conscious agents' neurophenomenological states, the more likely they will synchronized and feel mutual human relationship interconnectedness
Some say strong human relationships is more fundamental basic need than physiological needs in Maslow hiearchy of needs
We went from social coherence having pretty stable nonequlibrium steady states in villages stabilized by local culture and rituals to internet age that is constantly penetrating any attempts at stable cultural attractors by constant information overload from everywhere, leading to inability of individuals to synchronize in this extremely technilogically interconnected and also culturally polarized world
From (pre)modernism to postmodernism
Though i love the attempts at creating stable cultural frameworks by the synthesis of all good from all concrete frameworks into a metaframework (metamodern approaches)
Psychedelics and deconstructive meditation helps a ton to get out of concrete local minima, which can lead to belief network's constant unstability, which can generate both random concrete processes battling with eachother dissonanly not unified by their intrinsic similarity or some top down cybernetic controller leading to unpleasant mental chaos, or it can lead to empty mind full of freedom and nonsymbolic free symmetrical consonant flow of isness that buddhism and taoism loves
Another attempt is taking the great amount of conflicting processes from various cultural frameworks and try to stabilize them by creating s metaframework in metamodern synthetizing integrative ways, unify rational and spiritual enlightenement, unify various scientific schools of thought with unifying various spiritual schools of thought, or creating a metatheory on top of them, creating this global stabilization of concrete belief networks' topologies interconnected by general correlations 
See it all using the free energy principle fully general mathematical framework for formalizing any information processing system?

Democracy good, but does it fundamentally lead to unsustainability because of the overly competetive "nature" of humans in such big numbers because of uncomprehendable growing complexity? Educate about planetary cimolexity of wellbeing, disks, sustainability etc.? Can the nature be changes by cultural transformation? Fuse eastern spiritual enlightenement with western rational one? Cultivate planetary awareness?

Are all the current global survival and flourishing transformative evolutionary pressures strong enough to shift civilization away from selfdestruction? Do we need stronger positive influence in the most impactful causal destructive parts of our system?

Taky jsem zkoumal agency, p≈ôepos√≠l√°m z konverzace:
"Great talk about how limited metacognitive agency over thought and preferences is implemented in the mind [Conversation between Mark Solms, Chris Fields, and Mike Levin 2 - YouTube]([Conversation between Mark Solms, Chris Fields, and Mike Levin 2 - YouTube]([Conversation between Mark Solms, Chris Fields, and Mike Levin 2 - YouTube](https://youtu.be/1S4jaYjuzm0)))
aka the ability to decide what your next thought and preferences will be is limited by our phenotype (the set of observable characteristics or traits of an organism (in this case of our mind)) emerging from genetic and environmental influences
Technically Big five model of personality or Jung's archetypes are describing phenotypes
By being raised in specific culture also determines a phenotype in thinking and behavior
In dynamical systems language its an attractor
There also seem to be various neural correlates that determine the strength of forms of agency, such as disconnection of certain brain regions in unconctollable destructive addictive behavior.
Someone should invest heavily in brain computer interfaces enhancing the control over ourselves by strenghtening those neural networks üòÉ

I would argue the development of the networks implementing healthy sense of agency needs to be fundamentally supported by training them like muscles (genetics also play a role) so there's evolutionary pressures for them to be developed. This seems to be the fuction of certain meditation practices, going out of comfort zone practices, systematic dedication to one bigger task skill, stabilizing routine skill, or delayed gratification practices ü§î
Its also interesting how stimulants or lower doses of psychedelics tend to increase agency

Compassion is fundamental mental muscle to cultivating strong human relationships that are number one predictor of individual and collective wellbeing. We need more culture of compassion in our culture.

I love one lens on psychotheraphy, that lots of psychotherapeuts see their clients mechanistically and try to look for a mechanistic problem that needs to be solved according to predefined symbolic trees/ methodologies. This definitely has its use and should be used a lot, but fusing rationality with intuition is IMO ideal. But I would argue that to fully understand the lens of the other beings that might be deeply suffering, one should try to synchronize with them as much as possible mentally. Get as much as possible into their world by listening as deeply as possible, synchronizing breathing itself can increase sense of connection.

Something like tends to be practiced in Gestalt psychotherapheutic method for example. The deep compassion definitely has its advantages and disadvantages, as feeling the suffering of others so directly can really overwhelm one's mental state if not enough healing to get back into less suffering states is done. It also seems that in the current loneliness crisis, therapheuts tend to be the only people that create at least some human connection for some people that feel fundamentally lonely. We need more culture of compassion for people to feel more connected to eachother.

My current perspective:
From the perspective of moral responsibility for all of humanity, all of current and future generations and looking at current climate reports I would say we need to globally as humanity act more to minimize the acceleration and existing destructive effects of climate change as the current priority (you also have other crisises like mental health, loneliness, energy crisis, overall metacrisis with sensemaking, education etc., or potential risks including nuclear, pandemics, nanoweapons, bioweapons, artificial intelligence (full of lots of perspectives), volcanoes,...). The current coordination doesn't seem to be enough to address the increasing negative climate change statistics and the metacrisis when we look at the current statistics. What are the current core causes of the climate problems? Corporations with big power capital having the most systemic influence maximizing profits short term individually (as in, not caring about the whole humanity), caring just for themselves in polarized competetive dynamics. What are the solutions? What strategies do we have? Spread the message? Fixing symptoms such as carbon extraction from athmosphere, polution extraction, helping biosphere in other ways? Fixing its causes? Make cheaper and better green technologies in science and practice? We can transform the internal structure of the corporations. Use peaceful cooperative dialog in attempt to transform them? Science lecture inside them? Beat them economically by winning over them in competition? Create less psychopathic more compassionate and more globally morally caring corporations winning over them. Make green technologies more economically viable. Use language of money more? Use economical and political pressure on those psychopathic agents. Vote for green politicians? Sanctions? Altruistic financing? Use civil unrest pressure. Or damage them? Use violence? Or erase them? I understand Eliezer bombing GPU clusters to minimize unaligned AGI risk. Systemic revolution of steering our humanity superorganism away from selftermination with those cancerous cells slowly killing its host into a system not based on such strong psychopathic competetion? Attempt to rebuild society on collective meaning? But would that be enough force to stop the current strongest cancerous power structures screwing it up for everyone? Strenghten regulations? Strenghten global top down governance such as United Nations? That will create civil unrest from the psychopathic people and corperations (which already happens a lot), but if language of cooperation and peaceful dialog isnt enough, what then is enough? Are AI technologies accelerating it even more? Certain degree of competetion and arms races is evolutionary good and has certain advantages, like technological innovation, but too much of it leads us to those multipolar traps. Is peace enough? Is violence needed? Could violence lead to accelerated selftermination and disconnection instead of cultivation of culture of connection and harmony and resolving conflicting parts not aligned with the collective wellbeing? We dont want opression like in Russia, or chaos like in Somalia, we want something third that benefits the longterm wellbeing of humanity! Strong education about all of this? Culture of compassion and connection? Liquid democracy? Communes? Degrowth? What are other possible strategies? What are the most optimal combinations of those strategies to create the chances of the most efficient collective long term wellbeing, survival and flourishing? All of attempts individually add up into one giant force of care for all current and future generations! I believe we will succeed when we join forces together effectively!

Expand your caring cognitive lightcone to infinity

I wanna analyze Scott Alexander's brain. The wide context and depths of his writings are infinite. What do you think might be special about his qualia computer? Feels so free from evolutionary constrains and very effectively densely compressed tons of information.

Instead of asking "Is this inherently good or bad?" ask "What advantages and disadvantages does this have?"

Raw capitalism creates an evolutionary pressure/incentive/objective function of raw profits, incentives that go against what feels good to most people. Money on money dynamics even more. You can use top down restrictions to maximize chances of collective survival, increase collective long term wellbeing and meaning, but its not given that governing structure will be aligned with values of people, wellbeing etc., so it needs to be checked via for example multiple governing structures or ideally by democracy. To avoid lots of meaning and wellbeing and theory of governance issues when electing, we need education of people in those issues, not being stuck in one world view with focused attention, aligning values of the governing parts with the layman compatible with wellbeing/risks science. Power check and reduce psychopathic agents by culture of connection and compassion? Gene editing to enhance compassion? Can laymen people even be systematically thaught these complex topics, is that realistic? Or is the only solution some strong enough evolutionary pressure on the structue of the system from wellbeing, existencial risk, etc. scientists? Some kind or technocracy? That needs power and corruption checking too. How to approximately evaluate expertise to minimize psychopathic agents? Some academic system that isnt as broken as current academic system? And who checks that? Some metascientists/metagovernaning structures? Who checks that? Do we need antimoloch God under everything tonescape this loop? How to avoid psychopathic evolutionary pressures? Is centralized power fundamentally doomed? Degrowth? Decentralized independent donbar number communes only? Does that halt collective action against for example climate change? How to prevent tribal wars? Is that even possible with current total interdependence? Does current system halt efficient collective action as well? Somewhere yes in some problems (EU climate) somewhere not (USA) (collective sensemaking and wellbeing), but not globally, and we have the metacrisis. Can gametheoretically stable "ideal" system equivalent to benevolent illuminati Gods controling everything for long term survival and wellbeing of the people even exist? There is also issue of plurality of existing moral/ethical etc. systems. Respect or try to reform those dynamics or some middle way? There is also the issue of plurality of models of wellbeing and risks and that also come from plularity of values. Can we synthetize them? Create evolutionary selection dynamics between them measured by their success? Minimize friction between them in an ecosystem where they interact? How about plurality of methods quantifying and measuring success? All this prediction and measuring stuff also takes tons of computational power and complexity that might be incomprehensible, we must approximate and select various comprehensible factors like in climate science. What are the best approximator factors to look for in the system? We're back at the issue of plurality. Synthetize? Pick most fit ones? If we go from theory back to practice and editing what we already have, how to create the most efficient set of evolutionary pressures to steer the current system's structure more towards wellbeing and risk mitigation? Strengthten economically wellbeing/risk research in effective altruism and its education and influence?

If you're stuck in a job you hate I believe there is always a way to get unstuck and find meaningful work even if it means a lot of sacrifices

My biggest unknown is: What are the most effective interventions to our system that will a) increase the wellbeing of human population, b) increase collective efficient mitigation and resolving of symptoms and causes of risks and crises and c) making efficient material and psychological (that complement eachother) progress leading to flourishing. And how all those factors interconnect. How to make them respect, support and check eachother instead of fighting violently.

Could the underlying crisis be interpreted as valence crisis as a sign of dying humanity superorganism? Possibly too pesimistic interpretation. More like tons of before differianted human superorganisms attempting to merge together as their markov blanket boundaries dissolve together thanks to the internet, will we do it succesfully? Are we witnessing the statistical merging of Europe, then merging of Europe with America and rest of the world, is China succesfully stable markov blanket on its own? 

One of the reasons why lots of my interpersonal relationships are pretty unstable is that I basically have a lot of different personalities living inside of me that have formed in different periods of my life that I oscillate around and because some of radically different environments that formed some radically different subpersonalities they have a lot of trouble integrating with every other parts, so some of them live pretty separately and are activate mostly in the compatible environment, but lots of them also overlap, and all of them still want attention a lot of the time (existence among furries vs. existence among people who are into politics here in the Czech Republic or abroad or existence among people who are a lot into meditation, psychedelics, spirituality vs. existence in the family vs. existence among scientists vs. existence among technical people (which just kind of overlaps with furries) vs existence among ponies vs existence among normies vs existence among effective altruists vs existence among philosophers), I don't have any one concrete personality that's everywhere in all situations, but the closest thing to that is the part of me thats the most general, that wants to do good for everyone and increase wellbeing for everyone and survival of humanity and the best experiences for all living beings that cares for everyone like a mother. A grant request I was writing the last few days was exactly related to me wanting to map out solutions to the meaning and mental health crisis, metacrisis in general, and also the positive outlooks of the future, create a mathematical model for it (using Active Infernece), which allows for testing through simulations, and communicate them in impactful places, I want to go around to different centers, like centers of effective altruists, and give talks about putting those ideas into practice so they're not just in void. I may really hyperfocus on this one for a while now, but it might be ignoring the other more concrete parts of me, but maybe then again after some time I'll have a period where I'll explore my old parts again in different ways, balancing it all out. my most stable human relationships (all kinds, friends) are so far with those people that are similar kind of generalist thinkers

I doubt genetic profile has changed, let's look into environmental factors. A lot of people report not being satisfied with their job, not seeing meaning in it, such as for example soul numbing corporate jobs, living from paycheck to paycheck. We need to feel connected to the collective and feel like we're doing good for it. This is the loneliness/interconnectedness crisis. We must cultivate a culture of connection to fix this. There are so many asymmetries in cultural dynamics killing this. Instead of making money for overly rich boss that's not altruistic, we wanna feel like adding value to our ingroup directly. This makes sense evolutionary, as this is the conditions we mostly evolved in.

Compassion training into schools

The more local/smaller/concrete/rigid in the meaning graph the source of the positive valence is, the more it tends to be addictive aka narrowing the amount of things that bring us pleasure.

How to fix any problem:
Locate and name maladative symtoms (surface processes) and the core generating functions (cause) those symtoms.
Find and apply methods of fixing both symtoms and the core generator functions such that collapse of the system's stability doesn't happen by mathematical theory's derivation from the system's laws (regularities in time) or by experimenting.
Spread solutions throught the system by efficient massage passing and incetivize parts to cooperate on solving this problem. 
In the spacial case of the meaning crisis - Find what you're best at: theoretical research, practical research in different scientific fields, engineering, accounting, working with people, spreading solutions - and do that, ideally do what isnt done enough yet, where work towards survival and flourishing is missing.

Issue is that in "I don't understand what is making me feel the way I do, I just want to feel better." we think of us as separate from everything, which is one of the core drivers that fucks everything up.

https://twitter.com/algorithmwatch/status/1678800286062727168

Rivalious dynamics emerge from trust issues that emerge from failure of one agent giving dependence to other agent to reducing their uncertainity about basic needs

What do we want? Reduce uncertainity about our basic needs and (evolutionary pressured by nature plus nurture) learned goals driven by values (minimize Active Inference agent's free energy (decrease dissonance) of objective functions pretrained by evolution or culture or individual inquiry in interconnected societal system). Evolution pretrained us to automatically depend on others in family, community, culture, nation state etc. That's broken by genes correlating with psychopathy combined with environmental influences such as for example pollution, inflamation, or depending uncertainity minimizing mutual agent to agent bond being unsuccesful and thus breaking, leading to feeling hurt and cascading trust issues leading to asymmetries and rivalious dynamics and isolation and individualization of the agent or clusters of agents in their social graph in relation to mimimizing uncertainity about basic needs, leading to loneliness and dissolution of motivation for collective synchronized sensemaking and shared goals to survive and flourish collectively, which can is fixable by strong enough evidence that bonding is worth it to satisfy basic needs and goals collectively by compatible language or action. Leaders do collective uncertainity reduction this at scale.

Effective Individual And Collective Wellbeing Engineering For Collective Global Long Term Survival and Flourishing

Use collective sensemaking to create a global centralized map of current statistics of:
what is going right (heal diseases in novel ways) (other technological progress, reducing poverty)
what is going wrong (the environment is causing diseases) (metacrisis)

Integration Approaches To Effective Individual And Collective Wellbeing Engineering For Collective Global Long Term Survival and Flourishing Through Changing The Global System And Cultural Knowledge and Norms and Wellbeing Traditions 

If we dont wanna be tons of disconnected groups attemtping to solve the same thing in ways that can be cooperative rather than competitive

Global objective function (goal) -> Collective Global Long Term Survival and Flourishing Through Changing Maladaptive Parts Of The Global System And Cultural Knowledge and Norms and Wellbeing Traditions (Any priors and policies in the Active inference paradigm)

Priors that dont optimize for collective but only individual flourishing at the cost of collective flourishing are an issue, because they tend to, just like cancer, selfterminate their host in the long run 

Hey 
I love your work, I love how your trying to synthetize cultural definitiions of enlightenment from east and west. I also loved your sythesis of the memetic tribes of the metacrisis. I come mostly from data science background and look at this collective sense making using stuff like information theory, aligned with sillicon valley and effective altruism. What I'm concerned about is using the the most effective tools to enchance collective sensemaking and wellbeing to mitigate existencial risks, flourish and be well, so 

I'm also trying to map out all perspectices on the meaning/metacrisis. I was thinking that this kind of work could be accelerated and with higher impact created if we created some centralized tracker of what statistics go bad (such as climate change) or go good (such as technology solving diseases) and aligned solutions to making those sttiastics better

I'm working on a project where I try to frame those memetic tribes in terms of information theoretic language, and also integrate AI into this collective sensemaking, if you've ever heard of latent spaces and bayesianism or free energy principle or active inference. 

direct problem: rivalious dynamics
solution: changing the generation function by fusing with cultural eastern enlightenment by maximizing compassion which minimizes agents gain short term local profit instead of long term global profit (in terms of survival, flourishing, wellbeing)?

direct problem as a consequence:
existing agents benefiting themselves short term instead of long term for everyone driving climate change and exponential social media addictive tech destroying mental health meaning and so on
solutions: attempting to change the existing monopoly corporate giant's inner structure by enforcing wellbeing research into what they maximize (add values to the objective functions of facebook more [MEANING ALIGNMENT INSTITUTE]([MEANING ALIGNMENT INSTITUTE]([MEANING ALIGNMENT INSTITUTE]([MEANING ALIGNMENT INSTITUTE]([MEANING ALIGNMENT INSTITUTE](https://meaningalignment.org/))))) ) but also understanding their goals with compassion and economic incentives (slowly transform corporate mindfullness into deep compassion traditions by lecturing and practicing it?) will this be enough though, how to change the global maladaptive evolutionary economical incentives, are they centralized in corporates and psychopathic people with giant amount of power or distributed emergent dynamics from noncompassionate society and tons of generational trauma generating endless trust issues and driving disconnection crisis? how to direct psychopathic economic incentives into nonpsychopathic ones?? attempt at slow cultural transformation?? the fact that the cultural divide seems to be exponentially accelerating doesnt seem to be nice

create eductional institutions that have the goal of creating nonpsychopathic compassionate people wanting wellbeing for all?
popularize metamodern integrative approach to minimize disconnection?

Multiple agents in the same environment minimizing uncertainity with objective functions reducable to basic needs, aligned or misaligned with the collective, we need alignment

withdrawal symptoms from addictions are those subconscious predictions running, increasing tension/stress and when one cannot bear it anymore he gets back into the addictions
deconstructive meditation cleans the generator functions of those maladaptive predictions

This is how I think about everything: Markov blanket analysis can identify things as phenotypes as patterns that are conditionally independent and stable in evolution of space and time governed by flow and randomness, seen as bayesian model building and free energy minimizing
Connecting it with the QRI formalism of consciousness, Markov blankets with an implementation as a topological pocket in the EM field can be considered as individual experiences, with internal topological segmentations on the implementational level futher partitioning concrete nested hiearchical Markov blankets of experience on the computational level
This makes those concrete Markov blankets very stable, objective, nonfuzzy etc.. Many more Markov blankets can be identified in the brain, such as cells, whole brain regions, etc. that can also be nonfuzzy, or they can be dynamical and fuzzy, that don't correspond to concrete objective physicalist qualia themselves, but just for example some of its properties.

I also thought about the geometry of this totally relaxed symmetrical flow - no energy sinks that correspond to attention grasping a concrete object in any sensory modality and also not pushing it away, but instead through acceptance and relaxation entropically freely going through both of the classifiers without the classifiers being activated. Neither grasping nor pushing away, true nor false, percieving nor nonpercieving, nor middlewaying between any of those dualities. But just death of this subset of experience into loving accepting stressfree relaxed vast oneness full of freedom.

Methods to reduce stress
1) Solve the panicking basic need homeostat generating it by basic need fullfillment
2) Annealing activities like meditation that symmetrify neurvous system into more consonant dynamics - dont feed the source by grasping on it, denying it, pushing it away, by acceptance and relaxing, being with the whole field of awareness generally without concetrating on anything concrete
3) Substances that reduce stress via annealing or energy reduction or other methods

How to find meaning and selfactualization:
Hyperspecific obsession - after basic needs are met, hyperspecialized ecosystem of aligned problem solving subagents in one mind or collective that build structure by acting on mental states (example intellectual growth learning) (example sciences, philosophy, art, fantasy, knowing everything about rocks, theories of everything) or the world (example pragmatic application of knowledge in the real word towards some less or more grandiose visions) (example hobbies, engineering, cars, computers)

Community - social graph - leader, or collective of leaders (governing structures), has hyperspecific obsession, lead the collective into its wellness by high level management of subagents, (example state ideologies, utopian visions, collective risks) giving concrete meanings with common goal signaling by visions to the collective's parts by outsourcing needed actions (example engineering, science progress, and application, knowledge growth, solving basic needs, wellbeing engineering, surviving, managing existencial risks, upgrading, evolving, growing, entertainment, unifying culture engineering, engineering access to novel experiences or ways to relax, science communication, minimizing friction in ecosystem of interacting diverse differently evolutionary specialized total mental frameworks aka world views aka lenses aka points of view aka ways of seeing (evolutionary adapted hiearchy of bayesian priors forming homeostatic problem solving subagents through interaction interaction and with the environment by reading/writing states, reading signals reinforcing current state or pointing to or forcing change from others, sending signals aka massage passing in active inference)), beating outgroups in status and power (even tho noncooperative zero sum games of groups competing for same resources probably lead to disaster for everyone) (ingroup outgroup divisions are increased by individualization, increase of languages of what divides us, loss of languages of what unites us)
Relationships, family - similar to community but on lower scales, they tend to be bound by implicit biological synchronizations, but that seems to get dissolved in more psychologically or physically intimite, or polyamory communities, then there are people with lone wolf philosophy that are very individualistic 

Entropic dissolution into everything - in the extremely deconstructed meditation/psychedelics induced states, no concrete selforganized collective of problem solving subagents (clusters of coherence) fighting for attention but instead the contents of the field of consciousness is dissolved into one giant wave of mostly nonclassifying symmetrical activity (example jhanas, sense of merging with God) with some highly symmetrical structures forming as source of beauty (example nature, poetry, art), which is all also present in (nondual) (optimistic nihhilism) philosophies (just being, being like water (flow state not interrupted by rigid concrete expectations), seeing beauty in everyday things), trance is energizing by repeating (symmetrical) stacked patterns in sensory modelities that's overriding existing potentially dissonant patterns creating global symmetrical metastable attractor mind state that can be futher reinforced internally or from the environment by compatible proofs or overall tautological logic 

Growth, becoming superintelligent general or specialized God

Conflicts are the result of (overly) confident mutually asymmetric beliefs creating friction by selfevidencing attempts interaction increasing tension leading to blow up

lots of psychological problems are expression or consequence of repressed anger or technically any emotion like fear resulting in psychological stress 
https://twitter.com/nickcammarata/status/1673423275853221888
(and also chronic health issues https://twitter.com/bolekkerous/status/1673467064055414785 )
Meditations that let this anger and fear be free helped me a lot, anger can also be a form of tension
Anger can also be a form of tension/contraction 
the stress relieving strategies (like coping mechanisms) can sometimes be endless if the root cause isnt adressed (trauma, complex trauma, dukkha+tanha in general?)

avoiding modifying overwhelming weakening
weaking strenghtening transforming
concetrating on stillness

You can energize (reinforce) mental objects by directing attentional arrow to it, by it being aligned with valence gradient (aethetics, resolving basic needs), sensory data (what aligns with "reality" or imagined expectations is reinforced), surprise (prediction error adds entropic activity to fix prediction errors to tune models by finding policies to edit internal models or act on the world), you can also modify (transform) it into a more consonant shape, you can energize it so much that its dissolves by overwhelming, you can weaken attentional resources (forces) by globalizing them (attention to background stillness, vastness, silentness, boundarylessness, centerlessness, infinityness,...) resulting in global smoothening as local topological shapes in the neural tissue through global acticity gets more coarsegrained, more smoothened, more redistributed, and you can also avoid mental objects

We need optimal amount of both cooperative generalists and competing specialists in society

depression seems to be downstream of a mix of learned helplessness and a strong overwhelming tyranic and oppressive sense of fear thats closer to a freeze response

christianity is so evolutionarily fit in the evoltuionary dnyamics of cultural frameworks because it implements high valence structures (God as reality loves you) and spreads by converting or annihilating those who dont believe (treat others as you wanna be treated: if you didnt believe in god, you would want others to convert or annihilate you in this framework) [Thinking through other minds: A variational approach to cognition and culture - PubMed]([Thinking through other minds: A variational approach to cognition and culture - PubMed]([Thinking through other minds: A variational approach to cognition and culture - PubMed]([Thinking through other minds: A variational approach to cognition and culture - PubMed]([Thinking through other minds: A variational approach to cognition and culture - PubMed]([Thinking through other minds: A variational approach to cognition and culture - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31142395/))))))

there are many linear maps of cognitive development like spiral dynamics or stages of meditation by rogerthisdell but in reality it tends to be nonlinear where people tend to adaptively jump between stages depending on the context (being with family versus tripping on 5meodmt) but while on avarage being in some attractor set of states that can correspond to the baseline one is in most of the time (rigid modern ideological closed framework versus extremely open metamodern information processing dynamical system) https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1660164018332635136?t=XAOPGFHfi9MfAGFRoxwaRA&s=19

lacking inherent existence means That no models are ontologically real such as models of valence. Metarationalism combines those two approaches and says that our models just approximate reality so they're semirealist as long as they're somewhat predictive. That approach makes the most practical sense to me in sciences. 
Then there's the whole landscape of differently philosophically interpreting for example the maths of quantum mechanics which is technically irrelevant for predictions in science itself, but since we think in stories it let's us much easily grasp the maths and potentially more easily find ways how to expand or transform it. Also stories are the most effective for science communication. 

So you go by truth = predictivity? Both relativity and QTF still have unexplained phenomena or paradoxes, hmmm. Other approaches also try different paths, sometimes equivalently, but i feel like there are some intrinsic parts about nature that are unlearnable to us, as evolution might not optimize for truth but for survival, hmmm. 
How about emergent phenomena? I like Bobby Azarian approach there, by just explicitly including them, talked with him yesterday. [ActInf GuestStream #015.1: Bobby Azarian, Universal Bayesianism: A New Kind of Theory of Everything - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/_JCaic5Cxms) But i wonder if we can construct weak emergence model for aby emergent phenomena, I'm fan of that.
Then there's the whole fun about choosing arbitrary ontologies and other philosophical assumptions.
But i think the approach of classical emerging from the quantum might be the most fruitful in the future if we want to integrate fundamental physics with cognition!

If Markov blanket has to have classical information on the boundary memory then it makes sense when that gets disintegrated that we see loss of consciousness 
Consciousness as irreducible Markov blanket at the top of the predictive hiearchy, write only layer
Subjective conscious experience, fundamental Markov blanket prior, coupled with hiearchical machinery, of stuff like attention and world model, under its top down mental causation influence 
Source of fundamental active states, its structure not influencable by active states from lower levels
Nested quantum information theoretic reference frames
The topological pocket/global markov blanket is lowered in complex dimensional and functional content on deconstructive meditation and cessations disintegrate even the fundamental agential experiencing distributed irreducible Markov blanket ground 
This experiencing fundamental prior is beyond spaciotemporal abstract reasoning and concrete planning as well 
43:58 sounds exactly the problem of too much dimensionality in autism, giving parts too much degrees of freedom rips apart the emergent whole, leading to autistic phenomenology of no self by default
Or buddhist induce this metastable state by deconstructive meditation
Its interesting how deconstructive meditation can both increase dimensions through expansion of possibilities in some problem spaces but also decrease dimensionality by fully disintegrating the whole problem space solution seeking specialized machinery
Its a spectrum, concrete implementation gets generalized and expanded which increases dimensions and you can overfit in it but when you generalize too hard you underfit and it all collapses into entropy
Generalized by increase of information theoretic and thermodynamic entropy
low degrees of freedom as specialized solution that can be close minded -> more degrees of freedom resulting in greater complexity -> even more degrees of freedom resulting in unstructured disintegrated chaos of no more information encoded and all of it encoded in it at the same time in some sense
You can get more degrees from entropic activity, more neural density, more internal and global interconnectedness, more collapse of small world networks, creating more of a lattice than a spider web and you go full circle phenomenologically seeing one structure and infinite complexity together 
If everything is connected to everything else then there are no things
high energy behaviors as coping aka stabilizing mechanisms for brain network dimensionality fluctations resulted from autism or traumatic or other intense experiences that offsetted the stable equilibrium resulting in all sorts of hightolowenergy oscillatory mental divergences is such a great lens thats so allencopassing 

Use nothingness as a tool for freedom

Is statespace of qualia mathematically reducible to statespace of topological shapes from brain's neural network topologies? With hypothetical infinite computational power and infinite accuracy, could we predict any qualia just from those topological shapes? Does nonclassical phenomenological states beyond spacetime correspond to some neural network topology as well? Does unconsciousness correspond to absence of shape?

have some rest first
when im sleepy on meditation i just have a rest
jhanas are kind of superposition of being aware and rest
but depends which jhanas
you can generate pleasure or clean your mind by generating big empty space attractor inhibiting creation of concrete qualia structures and destroying even that leading to cessation
if parts of the mind are misliagined and dysregulated then thats hardcore to do
thats why attention should be trained also
that trains top down mental causation aka agency to even do this process
strenghtening the connections from the deepest cybernetic controlling networks with other brain regions
governing your mind first and then totally relaxing any governance

what are your thoughts on shit like Astral projection, near death experiences, DMT trips etc‚Ä¶

The functional properties of our mental faculties are as if there was massage passing in the (quantum information theoretic) electrochemical thermodynamical flow happening, as if attention was paid to certain qualia, as if it originated from somewhere and so on, as if it was happening in spacetime - all dissolvable on meditation, psychedelics, injuries and so on, all of those are useful network theoretic topological structures in the hardware that satisfy same input output mapping with useful functional efficient at stabilizing chaos compression [ActInf GuestStream 044.1 ~ Tsuchiya & Saigo: Category Theory, Consciousness, Integrated Information - YouTube]([ActInf GuestStream 044.1 ~ Tsuchiya & Saigo: Category Theory, Consciousness, Integrated Information - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/FymR0rKdLZo?feature=share))

The more metamodern one is, the more open his thermodynamic modelling information integrating system trends to be

everything is dynamical shapes 
functional properties or information is attractors in those dynamicaly changing fluidy shapes
classical observables in that quantum chaos
everything else is useful fiction
but even the shapes are useful fiction 
everything is empty
but shapes are the most general useful fiction out there

its all just predictive models to me with some story philosophical baggage so that it sticks coherently in our mind
everything is metaphor to some extend to me

shapes are the best most general ground language to me
i suspect you can get any functional dynamics from finding the correct underlying topological dynamics that approximates it enough with enough stability 
i think this is how brains evolved, slow evolutionary natural selection of network theoretic topologies of neuronal networks until we get all those functional properties of our mental faculties good enough to survive 
good enough selforganizing harmonic modes 
highly specialized but still adaptive in the end 
Burnydelic ‚Äî Today at 04:08
this is also an approximation, to be more complete you can add quantum nonlocality and other quantum baggage into it and have those classical dynamics as classical information emergent from quantum dynamics with bells inequality and so on (Sean Carrol, Chris Fields, quantum darwinism etc.) 

i feel i often see i destroy some of my top down inferntial cogntive apparatus by drugs or meditation, leading to living in more raw sensory experiences instead of infered interpretations or altered interpretations

i think in ADHD the arrow of attention is more like distributed chaotic arrows of attention that are attemtping to synchronize but have hard time and mutual tension creates mutual reinforcing 
which leads to inefficient formation of concrete accurate symbolic and nonsymbolic, emotional and neutral, beliefs about inner and outer states as well

What differiantes collective behavior of humans from collective behavior of cells is less rulebased more fluid general adaptible behavior creating collective flexible behavior that is still collectively unified and stabilized by norms which helps with the ability to simulate perspectives of others and align goals towards common uncertainity about basic needs reduction

Stableators as more general version of replicators
Replicators are special cases of stableators, patterns stable in space and time that stabilize their existence by replication function
"Immortal" patterns can have different stabilization strategies, like neverending healing or immortal hardware
In the mind's concept space, it makes sense for me to maximalize for replicators that enhance wellbeing and predictive and explanatory power
Planarias with their immortality can also be considered as stableators beyond replicators
Markov blanket analysis in the free energy principle is tool to find any stableators

Last few days I'm constantly living  in a prior of superposition of existence and nonexistence of the individual and collective sense of self, I love

Active inference evolution
This is the holy grail
Of how i think about evolution
Things as stable patterns in space and time across scales and levels of abstraction under the free energy minimizing on a statistical manifold evolution 
https://twitter.com/InferenceActive/status/1671522046407327747
This is how I think about everything: Markov blanket analysis can identify things as phenotypes as patterns that are conditionally independent and stable in evolution of space and time governed by flow and randomness, seen as bayesian model building and free energy minimizing
Connecting it with the QRI formalism of consciousness, Markov blankets with an implementation as a topological pocket in the EM field can be considered as individual experiences, with internal topological segmentations on the implementational level futher partitioning concrete nested hiearchical Markov blankets of experience on the computational level
This makes those concrete Markov blankets very stable, objective, nonfuzzy etc.. Many more Markov blankets can be identified in the brain, such as cells, whole brain regions, etc. that can also be nonfuzzy, or they can be dynamical and fuzzy, that don't correspond to concrete objective physicalist qualia themselves, but just for example some of its properties.

Pineal gland stories are mostly myths (the DMT one is, psychedelic activity without psychedelics on meditation is possibly created by global entropic activity, like what psychedelics do), if you want to locate concrete brain region as source of consciousness, it might be thalamus https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30005-2 , but the whole brain works as heavily interconnected network with fluid functional regions, not as isolated parts, so looking at just one part is eh [Luiz Pessoa | Funsy Seminar |  The entangled brain: the integration of emotion, motivation, ... - YouTube]([Luiz Pessoa | Funsy Seminar |  The entangled brain: the integration of emotion, motivation, ... - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA_X6NLU8pU)) and QRI suspects it might be a topological pocket in the EM field corresponding to brain activity (or organism's in general) that generates, or to be more precise: that is unified conscious experience [Solving the Phenomenal Binding Problem: Topological Segmentation as the Correct Explanation Space - YouTube](https://youtu.be/g0YID6XV-PQ)

My focus is lots of topics, mathematics, engineering, physics, neuroscience, philosophy, economic, political theory. My favorite lens is adaptive dynamical complex systems theory. My favorite framework combining all of those is quantum information theoretic free energy principle by Active Inference institute where I'm part of the community.

What I'm thinking about: how to make society well, how to formalize it in technical terms

Objective functions our mind generates are deeply evolutionary forces tied to basic needs combined with compatible with evolutionary niches cultural frameworks with their own objective functions.

Xmodernism in Active Inference 

Agency and free will is top down mental causation 

1. Think of the differences between annealing and canalization. How to avoid/fix canals? Examples can cover both social, cultural, and psychological contexts. Our main focus is psychedelic therapy.

1.1. Think of situations that lead to maladaptivity in canalization and how to prevent them. For example, psychotherapists can use tests to determine a client's attachment style which is important for understanding anxious/avoidant/disorganized emotional background and the way that they make assumptions about the world ("Everyone always leaves", "People look at me like they hate me", "I am afraid I will say something stupid", etc.). Previously diagnosed disorders and traumas should be taken into account and thought of with caution.

*Presumably, emotions are embedded within the low-frequency range, which is the one that can travel through the anatomical obstacles within the brain, while high-frequency harmonics tend to stop at the boundaries of brain regions. These emotions act as Bayesian priors for our limbic system.

Love or seeing constructedness (illusorynessness) of mental phenomena seems to be an universal dissolver of any mental object or conditioned reactive patterns of behavior canalizations. Or explicit relaxation of any contracted qualia.

Canalized Mr Meeseeks protective subagents - dissolve by showing them counterfactual proof that they dont need to be so defensive in a new environment and that they can relax.

Dissolving held psychotic (misaligned with other processes or destructive rather than helping) beliefs with showing them opposite evidence, relativizing them away.

Avoiding overly protective subagents by not getting into hostile environments or consume limbic hijacking fear inducing memeplexes on social media or news. Satisfy the objective functions and create compromises in your whole ecosystem of subagents having different priotiries, don't isolate any as then he tends to canalize protective structures hostile against others.

Depressive beliefs such as "Everyone always leaves", "People look at me like they hate me", "I am afraid I will say something stupid" are also dissolvable with counterfactual evidence. One can create a dialog between the hurt subagent and a "healer" subagent, asking about what it is, what its priorities are, how it was formed, what other beliefs or subagents it depends on

Some linguistic or abstract mental construction is seen as true if many observes agree on its validity using different epistemological strategies, beliefs present in a population can be disrupted or reinforced or novel ones created by mutating or creating a new belief that is compatible with the culture's current aethetics (superstructure framing priors that are preffered according to their consonance with the whole) and spreading it succesfully darwinianly.



2. We are aware of many examples/techniques for energy raising. Discuss techniques that can be applied for energy dampening and energy shifting. (For example, think of examples of how to manipulate energy sinks and sources by applying what we know from the STV. Which other activities/techniques can you think of? Discuss the role of attention!)
*Thalamic gating serves attention. "Cleansing the doors of perception": psychedelics disrupt thalamic gating, they excite neurons in the PFC and desynchronize their collective ability to represent coherent self-referential beliefs. Thalamus is especially rich with 5-HT2A receptors found to be important for distinguishing between the quality of serotonergic impact of SSRIs and psychedelics.

==

Any neural operator (psychotool or a substance) that symmetrifies neurophenomenology tends to also increase energy, probably because of disintegration of energy sinks so unsinked energy flows randomly with much less attracting forces, which might lead to seeing visuals as well. 

Energy sink can act as a neural classifier taking sensory data as input and outputing other thoughts or actions. Low energy depression seems to be damping energy through no learned agency. (hopelessness isnt learned, its that no agency is learned [Helplessness Is Not Learned - Neurofrontiers]([Helplessness Is Not Learned - Neurofrontiers]([Helplessness Is Not Learned - Neurofrontiers](https://neurofrontiers.blog/helplessness-is-not-learned/))) ) Which might be seen as no sensory patters cascading into possible actions, no dopaminogentic motivation. Symmetrical representations can create global cascade of activation of neural representations from just one through more interconnected neural topology (meditation and psychedelics increase that). We can damp energy by getting into gettign stuck into some one solid mental object. One can collapse from deconstructed entropic state back into some highly specialized context to concetrate all that free computational power into one task and use it all there, its asymmetry (high overfitted specialization) can damp overall energy. 

Any mental and physical activity that increases energy follows period of decreased energy, so thats a way to overall dampen energy as well. The stronger the increase, the stronger the decrease tends to be. Gradual increasing can be achieved by slow gradual increase such that neural networks adapt to a new baseline, just like progressive overload in fitness.

When it comes to shifting energy from one task to another one, one can in the global context see reason for doing that to generate motivation. We climb valence gradients realized as error reduction slopes of solving the problem better than expected, so depending on our aethtics and current problems we solve in life, we can shift our attention by lubricating those fundamental objective functions in our deepest bayesian priors, which also increases wellbeing through increased sense of meaning and motivation and reduces procrasination.

==

3. How important do you consider the role of positive expectancy in psychedelic therapy? Should there be a chapter dedicated to the creation of a positive and trustworthy relationship between therapist and client/shaman and tripper, and tripper and the drug? What kind of setting do you find ideal?

==

Yes, more trust, more bayesian prior, aethetics, goal synchronization, leads to more efficient belief transmission, more efficient updating of maladaptive priors. Ideal setting definitely depends on the cultural aethetics of the client - some people are raised religious, some secular, some think more in mechanistic terms, some think more in fantasy narratives and so on.

==

4. Role of music in psychedelic therapy. For example, the global flow of energy in the brain and reduced thalamic gating. Memorised music play VS jazz improvisation serves as an analogy for how the brain "plays" in the sober state VS on LSD. Could lower-frequency instruments such as hearing the bass-line play an important role in information propagation?

==

Songs are definitely also subjective to high degree as they active consonant memories through contextd ependant associations leading to good transformative trips. 
Songs with long global consonant tones are great for global information processing. Extremely fast songs are good at local information processing. Some songs have both in parallel which is great for combined information processing.

==

5. Good meditation objects. For example, cute things, breath as the most secular meditation object, tuning into empty space. (Mind the cultural differences.) Alternatively, do you have an interesting annealing habit?
6. It seems that high-frequency harmonics are in charge of higher cognitive functions, while lower frequencies store information and priors that activate the limbic system and DMN (Default Mode Network). This is widely discussed by Atasoy. Think of techniques that can be used for belief updating.

Another question for discussion (related to what you wrote in the document): How to navigate big-picture thinking (between therapist/shaman and client/tripper)? 

There are lots of ideas but I think we should come up with as many practical techniques as we can.

Also in general to just enable people for having more "surprising" moments in daily life, it seems that dedication to building knowledge is important. This doesn't have to be academic knowledge, but also philosophical. Many people are not equipped to understand how it's done just by hearing or reading instructions. It needs to be trained! It could be cool if we could find approaches for people with all sorts of different backgrounds.

But when it comes to politics in that chart i kind of doubt most of it. 
When talking with people that do politics irl in my country and suggesting some wellbeing science stuff, sometimes I feel like it would be better if there was some top down illuminati single ton controlling the system instead of this crazy selforganizing chaotic flow of competing economic or moral or other cultural incentives happening. üòÑ 

sleep
I sense it feels like its turning off the whole operating system so that certain organism's homeostatic functions can go back to their homeostasis when nothing is happening and then running stochastic activity as form of defragmentation 
its so similar with deconstructive meditation
and when you excercise maintaining awareness enough, you can sleep while being conscious too [Maintaining Awareness during deep sleep ‚Äî How to | by Roger Thisdell | Medium](https://medium.com/@rogerthis/maintaining-awareness-during-deep-sleep-how-to-19a3bd1a3561)
unconsciousness can be also conceptualized as no saving into memory
which also kills sense of time as the frequency of savings into memory also seem to determine time [Qualia Research Institute](https://qri.org/)blog/pseudo-time-arrow 
by turning off i meant the deep sleep that we dont remember
there might be qualia such as pain happening actually but since its not saved into memory we dont recall it ü§î like people on alcohol doing stuff and not remembering it ü§î 
by stochastic i meant flow of energy gets injected randomly, but what interacting qualia is selforganized in the neural networks is definitely not stochastic so thats why dreams have patterns and insights about us or anything else and solutions to problems when activity gets injected into correct neural networks encoding concrete patterns, otherwise pure stochasticity wouldnt have patterns 
injection of computational power, start of cascading brain activity is core feature of neural annealing that relies on injection of energy
long term memory also seems to be halted as the dreams we remember seem to be those that were generated right before we woke up stored in the short term memory 
and we still rewrite it a lot after waking up and trying to make sense of it as its not very ordinary experience
which is similar to interpreting and integrating psychedelic trips

I tried to draw the various states the brain can be in here
the total amount of energy corresponds to the total amount of brain activity (electrochemical activity) 
which corresponds to yellow lines
stochastic because its not conditioned by external stimuli
and
in similar ways how you think "randomly" about your future when doing nothing and not dissolving sensations
technically its not random as its dependant on what you're currently problem solving in the background, which is probably similar in dreams
dreams are more generalizing tho to avoid overfitting
this would explain why dreams are symbolic and usually not about highly specific situations or experiences
same for psychedelic trips or deep meditative states
as in all those cases you shift from local information processing to global information processing (from alpha band to theta band)
i call everything causing this symmetrifications as that leads to reduced concrete energy sinks (classifiers) leading to less restricted more free more global information processing 
and cessations are decrease in neural synchronization in alpha bandwith, dissolution of functional integration, functional linking between different ares of the brain, break down of coordinated message passing, increased phase lag index measure [Ep201: Revealing Nirodha SamaÃÑpatti - Delson Armstrong, Shinzen Young, Chelsey Fasano, Dr Laukkonen - YouTube]([Ep201: Revealing Nirodha SamaÃÑpatti - Delson Armstrong, Shinzen Young, Chelsey Fasano, Dr Laukkonen - YouTube]([Ep201: Revealing Nirodha SamaÃÑpatti - Delson Armstrong, Shinzen Young, Chelsey Fasano, Dr Laukkonen - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIEWAerJKOs))) [EEG Connectivity Using Phase Lag Index - Sapien Labs | Neuroscience | Human Brain Diversity Project]([EEG Connectivity Using Phase Lag Index - Sapien Labs | Neuroscience | Human Brain Diversity Project]([EEG Connectivity Using Phase Lag Index - Sapien Labs | Neuroscience | Human Brain Diversity Project]([EEG Connectivity Using Phase Lag Index - Sapien Labs | Neuroscience | Human Brain Diversity Project](https://sapienlabs.org/lab-talk/eeg-connectivity-using-phase-lag-index/))))

I suspect that insight cycle seems to be result of disintegration of neural networks that used to generate positive valence neural activity (conditioned consonance and dissonance generators linked to pain and pleasure circuitry https://twitter.com/SooAhnLee/status/1668040786368184320) by overflowing it with entropic nonsymbolic activity that it dissolves under the pressure. The search for a new stable configuration while in disintegrated state is a dark night of the soul. Finding a new more global interconnected internally aligned symmetrical configuration of the neural network topology that efficiently does stress dissipation and allows overall uncontracted brain activity corresponding to the phenomenology of qualia just being there without mutual dissonant inteference then leads to equaminity. Usually this isnt overnight but a process that takes time and I sense that do nothing meditation and love and kindness are best ways to do it. 

I think sometimes its good to just meditate or do just smaller doses of psychedelics as big dose of psychedelics can create the breakdown of everything including meditative progress, or accelerate it - depending on what kind of progress and what kind of psychedelics (strenghtening/transforming/dissolving beliefs) 
Do not try to escape the Matrix but engineer the most beautiful Matrix possible for everyone 
adding nervous system dimensionality increase or reduction having different computational advantages and disadvantages in abstract or social problem spaces and existence of evolutionary pretrained mental patterns useful for different specific or general purposes into this puzzle is also useful if one wants to engineer wellbeing

"We can expect ‚Äústandard-dimensional nervous systems‚Äù to be relatively strongly canalized, inheriting the same evolution-optimized ‚Äústandard human psycho-social-emotional-cognitive package‚Äù. I.e., standard human nervous systems are like ASICs: hard-coded and highly optimized for doing a specific set of things."
This default package from mostly outsider perspective is pretty odd in many ways. It just feels some variables that most people try to fill in as answers in the cognitive architecture are not really encoding anything useful. 
That there are more effective ways as well
But still its used for cultural cohesion
Some of it feels like evolutionary baggage in the collective cultural frameworks, code that hasnt been refactored, formed chaotically through nonlinear natural selection, just like our gene pool
"We can expect many of the behavioral and cognitive symptoms of autism to be compensatory attempts to reduce network dimensionality so as to allow structures to form. The higher the dimensionality and lower the default canalization, the more necessary extreme measures will be (e.g. ‚Äústimming‚Äù). ‚ÄúAutistic behaviors‚Äù are attempts at cobbling together a working navigation strategy while lacking functional pretrained pieces, while operating in a dimensionality generally hostile to stability. Behavior gets built out of stable motifs, and instability somewhere requires compensatory stability elsewhere."
That might also be why I love deconstructive meditation and 5-MeO-DMT so much. Ultimate dimensionality reducers. 
I feel that hostility to stability so much with my total psychological fluidity
But hey, that increases symmetry and therefore sense of freedom
But some more dimensional metapatterns still can create extreme stability when they're global and reinforced enough 

Problem with schools:
I study in a way that I find a group or person who's the best in the field and look at his text or lecture summarizing the field and then dig into the details while having context. I myself also maximize learning stuff related to wellbeing from all possible perspectives which isnt everyone's case. This is problem with lots of current schools. Kids report not knowing what the stuff they are learning is for. They miss context. It can be how its used in everyday life, future work, science of progress and wellbeing, sustainibility, unifying people and so on. Making money effectively can also be a goal but taking to the extreme kills collective wellbeing and coordinated existencial risks solving. No wonder they are unmotivated to learn it and interpret it as useless noise. Another factor is that school decouples learning from fun. Fun is a oelasure category our mind constructs to make play bereable and play is used to produce training data. If we look at how we learn in neuroscience, knowledge motly gets stuck in our mind if we evaluate it as relevant in our context for our goals that can be reduced to basic needs, we build a coherent unified model of the world where everything wants to relate to eachother in some way. Valence (internal and external attraction) crisis is killing this. That's why adaptive dynamical systems theory is the most effective metalearning language if one has a goal of maximizing predictive transdisciplinary scientific knowledge. Some people also have more individual or more collective goals. Modern society is too individualistic which connects to the meaning crisis and so on. I would also add training dialog by steelmanning deep goals and values of the motivated wants skill to education more.

Happiness depression classic Wiki page or overall Google all factors influencing happiness 

Reference canalization V2 u annealingu

3 types of love: very instinctive animal activities like body connection through cuddling, then feeling of belonging in one's social environment through deep meaningful human social connections, and a transcendental unconditional love for all beyond every concepts that the mind can dream up but also includes them all

Valence (internal and external attraction) crisis seems to in general be solved by some interconnecting memeplex on both individual and local level or all the other factors in equation of happiness. "Everything is made, comes from God, awareness." Any common beliefs, goals, values, ideology, philosophy, language, meaning,...

No bullshit mode - be as direct with yourself and others as its possible (without hurting in the long term ideally)

Thoughts are like winds in a sky

Experiental space and time are useful data compression tools. Same goes for any other structures in experience.

Meaning valence crisis is about destressing the individualist local structures and stressing collective global structures until they're stressless dissolved unified baseline

Spacetime may be seen as fundamental building block in quantum field theory or quantized/emergent from a deeper structure, let it be attempts at quantum gravity such as spin foam, strings, or gravitons. Or emergent from amplituhedron, or my favorite: from quantum information theory. This connects to the phenomenological intuition that experiental space and time are useful data compression tools for quantum information theoretic observers of some beyond language dynamics out there. Same goes for any other structures in experience.

Increasing trust with the goverment by signaling that values of the people are thought about more 

Silicon walley software economy

Moloch dynamics. I think this kind of mathematical dynamics can be applied scalefree in society and the mind. Psychopathologies can be seen as maladaptive nash equilibrium configurations of subagents. For example small perturbations can easily create tons of error signals in the system, putting it under stress which can unify it or destabilize it. Or trade off between freedom and governance, competition and cooperation. I care about both scales about everyone.

The problem with economy creating incentives that dont benefit wellbeing or longterm flourishing and multipolar traps is that you get competetive evolutionary arms races, exponentially growing compoundong interest in linear resource economy, physics of money making on money on money up to infinitum. This is unrealiable in long term. Exponentially growing economy was the solution to wars over resources moving from physical to economic scale. To sidestep resource scarity, silicon valley attempts to solve it by creating monetary value on software, but even that is limited as hardware and human attention is limited and wont grow infinitely. Attempting to redirect this towards an better nash equilibrium with more adaptibility to existencial risks and wellbeing of people without discoordinated competetive anarchy (too much freedom) or totalitiriam regime (too much control), but a third attractor, is hard.

Another big factor is to create intersystemic trust via steelmanning of values and satisfying as much parties as possible to diffuse tension and minimize friction to increase cooperation between clusters of agents and maximize alignment on the most fundamental level possible. (AIs joining the mix - use LLMs to understand LLMs is the most plausible method currently?)

More bio/cyber/etc. weapons (synthbio, AI,...) that might be as destructive as atomic bombs that might be even easier to make or control or monitor by open science and so on might be a bit of an issue.

Because world today is so interconnected and interdependant than before, destabilizing in one part of the world can effect the whole world for example economically. Climate change also effects everyone. Many of the risks are interconnected and there might be domino effects. Slightly more extreme weather killing crops creating mass economic migration putting stable countries under economic and cultural adaptibility load.

There will be always something underterminite when modelling and predicting a system, let it be quantum uncertainity, chaotic dynamics, the fact that we always approximate, or the fact that in order to model some systems we would need to simulate its evolution fully

We could maybe test what is needed for consciousness by slowly cutting off or replacing parts of the body and its systems to find out where the boundary is between conscious system and nonconscious system. Problem is pzombies or panpsychist assumptions assume that even an electron is conscious lol, so probably just the subject might know.

If the imposed dynamics imply better overall wellbeing of people and better global adaptibility to existencial risks, thats more positive sum for all to me. There are societies today or societies in the past that were more adapted or more well than others. It is determined by both internal and external factors.

Regulating climate change or AI has to be global because there are arms races and opponents that externalize costs to get local short term advantage at the cost of global long term get evolutionary advantage.

Meme complexes or organisms in general that evolutionary game theoretically win are those who dominate, convert, risk assert themselves as the only true one, such as Christian crusades, Alexander the great (or democracy is internally asserted as only good one) or China, where nonviolent Tibet is a failing strategy when it comes to survival.

Separation of power (market, church, state (legislature, executive, judiciary)) as an implementation of checks and balances as an immunity to prevent dystopian power monopoly and asymmetric dynamics. Hard to implement it long term in changing landscape of internal and external coniditons that needs to be adapted to and people forget why revolutions happened to destroy past power monopolies so they stop inhabiting asymmetric potentials through checks and balances of power structures and they start fusing into power monopolies plus sociopaths having evolutionary advantage. 

My favorite deconstructive meditation algorithm currently:
Dissolve concrete local stabilizing structural energy sinks such as thoughts, intentions, imagery, concepts, ideas, abstract thought, conditioned classified objects as constructed subsets of raw sense data with added abstract structure and feelings about them, percieving raw sensations themself, by tuning into quiet vast still spacious empty boundaryless centerless awareness, empty awake space, quieting the mind. See the emptiness (dreamlikeness) and dissolve global fundamental stabilizing stuctural energy sinks behind everything that form the sense of ground in experience by classifying and freeying them by for example spacious lightness - sense of doer, attention, watcher, self and other distinction, time, space, boundary, center, coordinates, background, knowing, local and global being, truths, ontology, somethingness, perception, nonperception, neither perception nor not perception, trancending the transcendence itself, any "fundamental" classifications, dissolve any logic, any distinctions, any structures in general. Destabilizing any codependently mutually (self)stabilizing clusters of symbolic or intuitive processes by raw not knowing and looking without concepts by generating stochasticity. After this deconstruction into unified stochastic void when everything starts reconstructing, throw in infinite love, kindness, caring, connectedness, healing, light, meaningfulness, protecting, cherishing, safety, comfort, smoothness for all mental objects that emerge in any reconstructed emerged dual category.

Put not really big money into happiness equation

Civilization can be analyzed in three ways that interconnectedly interact and influence eachother by interforming: what is its a memeplex (world views, value systems, what ought to be) (computational), social coordination strategies (behavior, financial incentives) (algorithmic) and physical tooling set upon it depends (tech) (implementational). What changes in all three od them simultaneously, factoring all the feedback loops, produce a virtuos cycle that orients in a direction that isnt catastrophies or dystopias? Cumulative exponential tech level is currently the most dominant and binding all other levels instead of the other way around. We need values of the people to bind tech instead. Those values can be elected into governance via will of the people via democracy with checking and balances of power from the people and by separation of power, preventing opression, tyranny and dystopias, creating aligned emergent instead of imposed values, by educating people both scientifically and morally and theory of governance, such that collective will of the people isnt dumb and misguided to govern exponential tech and selfterminate creating catastrophies but instead bind it for long term adaptive wellbeing by thinking about its nth order effects without big narrow techno pessimist or techno optimist bias universally globally to prevent arms races to not selfterminate the whole world by multipolar traps. Unity via less narrower more connected through more fundamental similarities value systems preventing stuff like left right polarization.

Cuddling is great thoughts removal

Free will is a felt sense of agent's model of causal power of his individual organism over the global world 

So many things people sense as eternal fundamental truth goes beyond my sensed experience where nothing is really eternal (but even this what I'm writing can be morphed into its opposite or synthesis) because I can morph into the state where it feels true but morph into a counterfactual one where completely different opposite mental framework with its own assumptions and inferences makes sense, so senced truths to me are just contextdependent states
All just pragmatic tools for different purposes
Trying to spread evolutionary like replicators
Sometimes good, sometimes bad for different dimensions such as wellbeing, predictivity, belonging and so on
That's why it makes sense to me to get infected by memes that maximize those the most
Another parameter could be sense of freedom, special case of symmetrification, or loveficitation with any mental objects or field of experience in general as another kind of symmetrification
Free will is another variable in the cognitive architecture that people have, and if you really implementat the "i have no sense of agency" bayesian prior strongly, then you can get into nihillistic depressive dissonant attractors, or also ones full of freedom, depending if its surrounded by implemented western or eastern philosophical mental construct context lol, and what objective functions you have implemented inside you that can generate error signals when they cannot be selfactualized and socially validated and so on
"Enlightenement is the ability to see experience as process." -Kenneth Folk

Free will?
I think depends. I suppose you're classical hard physicalist determinist with no free will mechanistic implementation in physics present. If you account for certain insights from complex systems theory, you can get free will from top down mental causation fictious force. You can also assert that free will is just a cultivatable feeling, agent's model of his causal power over his mind and environment. (my favorite pragmatic definition) You can also be ontologically agnostic about free will by arguing that our models are just approximation of some reality beyond our usual concepts.

Letting go is hard to put into words, its like relaxing the machinery of the mind you normally abide in. Temporarily turning a mental process off. With enough repetetion you can uninstall or transform maladaptive patterns in mind or behavior.

Turning off trying in the brain manifests as relaxed circuits in the default mode network, so instead of going to ruminate and stuff, you are in the present moment with much less processing of anything. Global workspace wont get as many external signals what Is avaiable to work with, in the extreme you "experience nonexperience". This article also has neat practice instructions:

When it comes to priors, its just hiearchical assumptions about oneself and the world with computational implementation in the brain, linking this lecture is probably great starter.

I guess the easiest sign of bigger energy parameter is less tiredness on avarage, more excitement, sense of more total amount of computational power and total consciousness. Can be distributed among the whole world model (contenment) or directed towards one mental model (can manifest as obsession, which is great for concrete problem solving, and the other one for out of the box thinking, so combination is great)
Also wellbeing benefits from symmetrification of the nervous system from distributed activity among the whole model creating global interconnections, increasing small world networkness, collapsing maladaptive local hiearchical structures.

For science I mostly abide in a form of neutral monism (quantum information theoretic Markov blanket monism) or classical physicalism or panpsychist psychicalism: maths of physics=maths of mind.

In social context when people around me are mostly in some ontology I just adapt to theirs by becoming that one

For meditation I abide in idealism at first as that increases sense of agency over ones mental state, but then dissolve even that into every possible ontology and none of them at the same time when everything gets deconstructed.

In general: Metastability. In order to make the most out of pleasant doing better than expected error gradient good slopes that are at right at the edge of our capability, the predictive system must be sometimes willing to disrupt its own fix point attractors. It must be willing to go beyond its habitual policies, to go beyond its extremely well known ways of selforganizing, beyond its own homeostatic set points.

What matters is how well the model is supposted by empirical data and can predict other empirical data through hiearchical structures, mechanisms or symmetries. Also some of the models are more easily used daily pragmatically for for example wellbeing engineering or its more pleasant and higher in wellbeing to have them actively in mind, which is determined by their valence, which seems to be mostly determined by how much they unify things or prove the carrier's enemies wrong.

There "exists" a landscape of predictive models, where different models are more predictive in different domains, or many models are equally predictive in the same domain. An example of such a collection of models is different models in physics, such as the mathematics of quantum mechanics and general relativity, or in general polycomputing [[2212.10675] There's Plenty of Room Right Here: Biological Systems as Evolved, Overloaded, Multi-scale Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10675) , and each such model has infinitely many possible philosophical interpretations, such as many interpretations of quantum mechanics or matter/mind/both/none/something else/god/all is fundamental ontology, which doesn't change their predictive power.

The way our reward architecture is constructed makes it difficult for us to have a clear sense of what it is that we enjoy about life. Our brains reinforce the pursuit of specific objects, situations, and headspaces, which gives the impression that these are intrinsically valuable. But this is an illusion. In reality such conditions trigger positive valence changes to our experience, and it is those that we are really after (as evidenced by the way in which our reward architecture is modified in presence of euphoric and dysphoric drugs and external stimuli such as music). We call this illusion the tyranny of the intentional object because in philosophy ‚Äúintentionality‚Äù refers to ‚Äúwhat the experience is about‚Äù. Our world-simulations chain us to the feeling that external objects, circumstances, and headspaces are the very source of value. More so, dissociating from such sources of positive valence triggers negative valence, so critical insight into the way our reward architecture really works is itself negatively reinforced by it.

I feel like the most efficient way of making change in the real word towards better sum of wellbeing of a population on a global scale is popularizing efficient therapheutic methods, pushing denormalizing chronically stressful etc. life culturally via politics, focusing on what unites us, instead of what divides us, making different kind of memetics optimizing for wellbeing more normal.
What do you think is an efficient way to reduce this kind of suffering in population?
Or will singularity catch up and give us technological infinite bliss before we collapse under stress? Maybe for some minorities.

"become" "mental construct fluid" and never worry about in what "social constructs" "you" fit in ever again

the more general your nervous system is (the more experiences it make make sense of) the harder it is to kill it
the more you die the more it expands
making it even harder
but eventually you can get into permanent death
tho i wonder to what extend can permanent death work, because you still need basic biological functions and ability to communicate
you can get this constant always active highly symmetrical everything interconnecting attractor that is extremely pleasant (its a spectrum)
nondual philosophy or complex systems also generate this, but transcendental meditation and psychedelics seem to go more directly
the more you get into these states the more you learn to make them last longer
you can remove craving for both existence and nonexistence, by unifying existence and nonexistence for example, seeing the nebulousity of real things and experiences
ego death can be defined as when even your most fundamental priors and conceptual sense making things dissolve
if you can still frame the experience, if its not uncomprehensible, full entropy, no anythings pattern matchable, then its still inside some structure 
the experience of nonexperience goes beyond ego death in this frame?
the experiental nonexperience of nonexperiental experience, smash the nondually nondual duality 

people scared of ego death are scared of uncertainity, not knowing, being lost, loss of control, death of the stable structures that make them what they think they are
on the other hand some people arent scared at all and then experience loss of control and can do not so good things
transcendental philosophy such as buddhism prepares you for psychedelic experience by deeply ingraining the postulate that everything seemingly stable is fluid and impermanent and that reality is fundamentally nonconceptually incomprehensible 
but one can go beyond the duality of comprehensibility and noncomprehensibility

I feel like the current scientific ontology of physics is stuck in a quantum field theory attractor because in order to mentally simulate all the order outsiderish but in some places more deflatory or predictive theories you have to bend your mind out of or intuition, out of what we evolved for.
We make simulations of content in spacetime model so that gets reflected in our physics so thinking without spacetime is hard to compute for most people so it doesnt stick.

bayesian brain meditation

stuff i wrote to furry rationalists group

The way to feel effortless infinite flow of life seems to be in general implemented by having higher order process out of the character's agency (this ideally as a parameter that can be set via various actions such as meditation) fueling all lower order processes
That's phenomenologically universe doing things for you and "you" just sit down and watch it unfold
Agency implies effort
Effort (sense of doer) implies asymmetries 
Aka conceptual contractions saying what's good or bad, running counterfactual simulations and forces in the motorplanning space
Flow of life implies nonduality, conceptlessness, symmetries, expansion and contraction at the same time 
This can result in falling in reward circuitry hijacking traps tho, there the conceptual mind is useful
Or in groundless ground that isn't vast, still, spacious, accepting etc. - that is useful to cultivate to be functional while dissolved at the same time
Flow implies surrender
Ordinary life becomes like watching wild animal documentary
vast, still, spacious, accepting etc. groundless ground implies positive valence
Judgements, categories, go against unconditional love 
This also makes tripping much better
Life is one giant trip anyway 
Unify psychedelic and meditative bliss with sober/dual reality!

Universal middle way thinking pattern nonduals (dissolves) all symbolic conceptual dual mental constructions: identify a duality (something is true and opposite isnt), accept both sides, merge them, synthesis.

What also seems to effictify guided meditations or love and kindness is that the instructions or compassion is coming from every part of the groundless ground (or infinite awareness) at once

mental wellbeing is an engineering problem. 

I love this, and it's interesting how belief in the supreme selfcontrol metacogniton metaselfprogramming without limits of the mind over its thoughts and emotions or sensations in general maximizes effectivity of this skill, of this capability, essencially skyrocketed placebo at its limit. But at the same time it can create unrealistic expectations where one feels dissonant prediction error when something that is beyond one's mind control at that time happens, because of a stressful environment for example or when molecular neurobiology is broken in some sense and would require fixing the emergence of some types of neurotransmitters when there's too little or too much of some of them for example or when the brain tissue has some malfunctioning part such as a tumor, or with locally hyperconnected default mode network (your evolutionary old processes, animal self) and not so connected different brain regions creating less harmonious flow of information creating worse ability for the brain work as a holistic singleton, creating less symmetries and worse wellbeing, or less trained prefortal cortex (executive central network) that actually implements selfregulation or the sense of free will. Some types of neurobiology can create attractions towards dissonant reality tunnels. Or when structure of the neural networks require more training to implement selfregulation over some subset of experience, such as you cant instantly be the best in the skill of playing the piano, which applies to any other metacognition skill imo, I see all skills as a trainable continuum with possible transmittable general learned skills, or when one gets captured by some reward mechanism hijacking tool such as too frequent social media, some types of food, some substances, porn,... 
And for example this reward mechanism hijacking is killing what makes us happy, overstimulating reward circuitry based on dopamine, endorphins, internal opioids, and if that one thing the reward circuitry is trained on is not connected with other things in the brain, such as social connection or subjective sense what ought to be in ethics and the world model, that impairs holistic internal interconnectedness, which impairs the emergence of a meaning vector, and through meaningless hyperstimulation creates tolerance to further reward signals, sinking into "nothing feels rewarding" belief attractor metastable brain configuration. There are definitely many other possible factors that can are against wellbeing, such as dissonant (meta)memeplexes that are strongly solidified and create even more dissonance when they are destabilized instead of updated to a more consonant version or dissolved.

I am more thinking about symmetry theory of valence in terms of statistics, data science: the more easily the brain activity propagates in the neural tissue, the more flow there is, the more symmetrical it is, (less energy sinks, concrete attractors, classifiers, local contractions, potential for dissonance there is) and this lens maybe doesn't need hardcore maths.

Relieving suffering and bringing gradients of bliss as a basic right to all beings is a nice one that QRI is centered around.
From a certain lens nobody is fundamentally bad, everyone is maximizing wellbeing under their current beliefs the best they can, (its bayesian optimal behavior) but sometimes some beliefs include hurting others (physically or on the level of nonlinear wave computing dissonance in the nervous system through language), which can create conflicts (disharmony) between two belief systems ü§î

Instead of resisting and suppresing exiles, parts of you usually created by negative experiences that you try to fly from or fight against or freeze before.

Internal family systems theraphy helps them by listening to the source of the negative emotions by letting them express themselves, noticing why are they there in the first place, what part of you generates it. You can create a dialog between it and a good new part of me, showing it that everything now is safe with love, joy and compassion, that it doesn't need to be defensive and hurt anymore, all is good little boy, have some love candy as a treat. ü§ó And then I explode in pure love to everything and everyone. üò∏

Depression, traditionally viewed as a disorder characterized by negative cognitive biases, is associated with disrupted reward prediction error encoding and signaling. Accumulating evidence also suggests that depression is characterized by impaired local and long-range prediction signaling across multiple sensory domains. The review focuses on studies of sensory deviance detection and reward processing, highlighting research evidence for both disrupted generative predictions and prediction error signaling in depression.

I think "A Sensory-Motor Theory of the Neocortex based on Active Predictive Coding" paper can help with a lot of phenomenology!

God, or ontology and morals in general, as this ultimate abstraction on the highest level that controls everything else in the lower levels in some ways, and top down processing!

The paper:
[A Sensory-Motor Theory of the Neocortex based on Active Predictive Coding | bioRxiv]([A Sensory-Motor Theory of the Neocortex based on Active Predictive Coding | bioRxiv]([A Sensory-Motor Theory of the Neocortex based on Active Predictive Coding | bioRxiv]([A Sensory-Motor Theory of the Neocortex based on Active Predictive Coding | bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.30.522267v1))))
A Sensory-Motor Theory of the Neocortex based on Active Predictive Coding
We propose that the neocortex implements active predictive coding (APC), a form of predictive coding that incorporates hierarchical dynamics and actions. In this model, each neocortical area estimates both sensory states and actions, and the cortex as whole learns to predict the sensory consequences of actions at multiple hierarchical levels. ‚ÄúHigher‚Äù cortical areas maintain more abstract representations at larger spatiotemporal scales compared to ‚Äúlower‚Äù areas. Feedback from higher areas modulate the dynamics of both state and action networks in lower areas. This allows the cortical network to model the complex dynamics and physics of the world in terms of simpler compositional elements (state transition functions). Simultaneously, current higher level goals invoke sequences of lower level sub-goals and actions, allowing the network to solve complex planning problems by composing simpler solutions. Planning (‚Äúsystem 2‚Äù thinking) in turns allows the network to learn, over time, perception-to-action mappings (policies; ‚Äúsystem 1‚Äù thinking) at multiple abstraction levels. We provide examples from simulations illustrating how the same APC architecture can solve problems that, at first blush, seem very different from each other: (1) how do we recognize an object and its parts using eye movements? (2) why does perception seem stable despite eye movements? (3) how do we learn compositional representations, e.g., part-whole hierarchies, and nested reference frames for equivariant vision? (4) how do we model the ‚Äúphysics‚Äù of a complex environment by decomposing it into simpler components? (5) how do we plan actions in a complex domain to achieve a goal by composing sequences of sub-goals and simpler actions? and (6) how do we form episodic memories of sensory-motor experiences? We propose a mapping of the APC network to the laminar architecture of the cortex and suggest possible roles for cortico-cortical, cortico-thalamic, cortico-hippocampal and cortico-subcortical pathways.



I also think this can be framed by nonlinear wave computing, where smaller waves (more concrete elements) interlock and create bigger waves (bigger stories, more abstractions).

"Merging with God as a kind of global coherence:

> Andres suggests all of this is a good match for oscillatory coupling between brain regions.

Perhaps add something akin to ‚Äúwhich according to him ‚Äòdissolves internal boundaries'‚Äù

> Andres thinks this is part of what‚Äôs behind ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù or ‚Äúmystical‚Äù experiences, where you suddenly feel like you‚Äôve lost the boundaries of yourself and are at one with God and Nature and Everything.

My strongest phenomenological evidence here is the difference between DMT and 5-MeO-DMT (video): competing clusters of coherence feel like ‚Äúa lot of entities in an ecosystem of patterns‚Äù whereas global coherence feels like ‚Äúunion with God, Everything, and Everyone‚Äù. Hence the terms ‚Äúspirit molecule‚Äù for DMT and ‚ÄúGod molecule‚Äù for 5-MeO-DMT. The effect size of this difference is extremely large and reliable. I‚Äôve yet to find someone who has experience with both substances who doesn‚Äôt immediately agree with this characterization. [This can be empirically tested] by blinding whether one takes DMT or 5-MeO-DMT and then reporting on the valence characteristics, ‚Äúcompeting vs. global‚Äù coherence characteristics, and on whether one gets a patchwork of entities or one feels like one is merging with the universe.

With classic psychedelics, which stand somewhere between DMT and 5-MeO-DMT in their level of global coherence, you always go through an annealing process before finally ‚Äúsnapping‚Äù into global coherence and ‚Äúbecoming one with God‚Äù. That coherence is the signature of these mystical experiences becomes rather

<@244200615616446465> posted pretty powerful introduction to QRI:

‚ÄúLast summer, I had the privilege of interning at the Qualia Research Institute (QRI), a non-profit organization dedicated to discovering the science of consciousness. I distinctly remember one night at QRI ‚Äì May 31, 2019 ‚Äì that likely changed the course of my life. I was sitting in a circle with the two other interns and the managers of the group house where most of the QRI team was living at the time. We were discussing the importance of conducting research on consciousness, and one of the interns mentioned that the science of consciousness was the ultimate problem. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said (and I paraphrase), ‚Äúthe only things that really matter to you are the things that impact the quality of your conscious experience. If we figure out consciousness, then we will know how to induce conscious experiences that are far more extraordinary and blissful than we can even imagine right now.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs when it hit me. I had a very ephemeral and abstract, but nonetheless deeply profound, vision of a world that was completely free from pain and suffering. I caught a faint yet radiant glimpse of paradise. I imagined a world in which scientists had eliminated depression, anxiety, existential insecurities, and all other forms of mental agony; in which sublime joy was the default mode of conscious experience; in which every human felt unconditional love towards all other sentient organisms; in which every human was overwhelmed with ecstatic gratitude and awe at the simple fact of being alive.‚Äù

Wandering mind is unhappy mind

When you think about the equation of happiness, you think out the equation is not thinking (yes in theory, partially in practice?) (with functional biohardware)
You are the reflection of your environment. The people you are around, the content you watch shape your beliefs and reactions. In unloving, judgmental, scared, panicking, hopeless, disconnected, resisting, ingroup outgroup categorizing, environment, one becomes that and feels disconnection, isolation, dissonance, uncertainity, loneliness etc. which causes stress aka inner dissonance which causes most negative mental properties such as anxiety or depression. If a person is in an environment full of love, enthusiasm, joy, energy, compassion, spontaneity, inner peace, helping, healing, wakefulness, trusting, wisdom, humbleness, generosity, relaxation, allowance, nondual interconnectedness of people, absence of resistance to what is, no grasping hyperfixation to concrete thoughts or emotions or sensations in general, etc., one is becomes like that too. All the more positive valence properties seem to share the property of symmetrical thinking, aka easier information flow, less inner tension of experience fluid and less uncertainity of beliefs, or raw nonsymbolic experience where nothing is judged by concepts. Genes can determine initial attractions towards different environments and styles of thinking, but its very plastic when it comes to environmental factors. Meditation or psychedelics increase this plasticity that allows one to change his beliefs even more. Environment, let it be online or in real life, that supports this, makes one feel connected even more. Good regulator theorem from cybernetics plus symmetry theory of valence plus buddhist conception of suffering give interesting pointers to engineering mental wellbeing.

Relaxing the body relaxes the mind and other way around.  Meditation or/and theraphy to identify the sources of tension and relaxing them by befriending, updating them, which can also be helped by substances. Fullfilled basic needs are important too. Tension is associated with x, relaxation is associated with x. Tension is negative valence aka asymmetries aka worse information flow. Relaxation is positive valence aka symmetries aka easier information flow.

Encode as many information in the least amount od bits possible by finding common structures among as many structures as you can. Spirit of category theory and complex systems. I wonder if there is any other label doing the same process.

I see all those mental divergences from norm as spectrummy clusters of patterns in behavior caused genetically and environmentally that can create both adaptive or maladaptive patterns in behavior or neurobiology producing more than avarage suffering or happiness depending on the patterns. It can have evolutionary functions (such as being tribe leader, engineer, healer,...) to which one can adapt, but it also can make one desynchronize with the environment or in general with himself internally, creating suffering for the individual, and neurotheraphypharmatechnological methods or any behavior correlating with happiness empirically can change the neurobiology to make the individual fit in his environment more or help his neurobiology have dynamics that supports having hedonium in the first place, making him suffer less. On the other hand in some cases some proposed methods can contract him into social constructs and happiness conditionings which can kill his ability to see freeying emptiness and feel unconditional love. Aka why i didnt want to take calming meds when I havent figured myself out yet. It felt like solving symtoms instead of cause, it couldnt help me find fullfilling meaning and i didnt want to be nihilistic not thinking individual, it felt like escaping method, that's why I always want to go to the source of the problems. Different systems also maximize different things with different intensities with different philosophical and political systems. Happiness or agency or productivity or technology or spirituality for example, after basic needs of people are met (not always haha), which determines what should be normal by social constructs,... Its fascinating how different cultures have different set of normal behaviors and therefore different definitions of mental divergences that dont make the individual fit into the environment which then tries to fix him to fit into the environment. Avarage modernist american/european city where psychosis is seeing empirically unmeasurable stuff (which sometimes breaks down haha) versus buddhist monk centers where its weird to not be dissolved versus spiritual groups where experiencing minds to the fullest isnt weird versus hyperfundamentalist muslim or christian countries where not believing in god is sign of devil that needs to be fixed with with neurotheraphypharmatechnological intervention. I'm an individual that loves to play with his internal models in the sea of atheistic Czechia, which isnt very compatible with most people here lol, but i can find compatible people where anyway. But I'm glad we don't tryhard capitalism as hard as America. The very process that makes us effectively adapt to the environment by selecting relevant information in sensory data and constructing relevant for survival and collective goals useful hypotheses/models about them makes us vulnerable to selfdestructive dukkha suffering spirals. ADHD, causing the individual to jump from one thing to other on his mind, having trouble finishing stuff, forgetting stuff, or autism making the individual create meaning of life around super specific topic, which makes him not being able to talk to people with normal social constructs, can create suffering. But combined gives the ability to do asperger like hyperfocus on topics that are extremely meaningful for the individual, which can on the other hand create meaningful life, status, sense of freedom,... It has to be compatible with the environment tho, to sustain the individual with the collective. To reduce individual's sense of uncertainity of his basic needs and meaning of life being fullfilled,... it can be adaptive or maladaptive. Stress is mostly not good neurobiologically for hedonium belief networks with consonant activity and functioning biohardware that isnt collapsing even tho it can enhance concrete productivity. You also dont want configurations that permanently break down some needed brain's functions such as for example consistent inner world simulation or ability to model somewhat coherent stories to make you survive with the environment or not getting sucked into bad wellbeing attractor.

Love is the existencial stance with reality, way of commiting yourself to a partiular connection in the outer or inner world, or to any thought, concept, process in general.

3 types of love: very instinctive animal activities like body connection through cuddling, then feeling of belonging in one's social environment through deep meaningful human social connections, 

and a transcendental unconditional love for all beyond every concepts that the mind can dream up but also includes them all

Consciousness Is a Thing, Not a Process

The central dogma of cognitive psychology is ‚Äòconsciousness is a process, not a thing‚Äô. Hence, the main task of cognitive neuroscientists is generally seen as working out what kinds of neural processing are conscious and what kinds are not. I argue here that the central dogma is simply wrong. All neural processing is unconscious. The illusion that some of it is conscious results largely from a failure to separate consciousness per se from a number of unconscious processes that normally accompany it‚Äîmost particularly focal attention. Conscious sensory experiences are not processes at all. They are things: specifically, spatial electromagnetic (EM) patterns, which are presently generated only by ongoing unconscious processing at certain times and places in the mammalian brain, but which in principle could be generated by hardware rather than wetware. The neurophysiological mechanisms by which putatively conscious EM patterns are generated, the features that may distinguish conscious from unconscious patterns, the general principles that distinguish the conscious patterns of different sensory modalities and the general features that distinguish the conscious patterns of different experiences within any given sensory modality are all described. Suggestions for further development of this paradigm are provided.

The brain is not mental! coupling neuronal and immune cellular processing in human organisms

Significant efforts have been made in the past decades to understand how mental and cognitive processes are underpinned by neural mechanisms in the brain. This paper argues that a promising way forward in understanding the nature of human cognition is to zoom out from the prevailing picture focusing on its neural basis. It considers instead how neurons work in tandem with other type of cells (e.g., immune) to subserve biological self-organization and adaptive behavior of the human organism as a whole. We focus specifically on the immune cellular processing as key actor in complementing neuronal processing in achieving successful self-organization and adaptation of the human body in an ever-changing environment. We overview theoretical work and empirical evidence on ‚Äúbasal cognition‚Äù challenging the idea that only the neuronal cells in the brain have the exclusive ability to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù or ‚Äúcognize.‚Äù The focus on cellular rather than neural, brain processing underscores the idea that flexible responses to fluctuations in the environment require a carefully crafted orchestration of multiple cellular and bodily systems at multiple organizational levels of the biological organism. Hence cognition can be seen as a multiscale web of dynamic information processing distributed across a vast array of complex cellular (e.g., neuronal, immune, and others) and network systems, operating across the entire body, and not just in the brain. Ultimately, this paper builds up toward the radical claim that cognition should not be confined to one system alone, namely, the neural system in the brain, no matter how sophisticated the latter notoriously is.

The absence of fear makes us more susceptible to exploitation and it makes animals more susceptible to predation. There was one study in which mice with FAAH knocked out drank more, however that's likely due to the absence of the throat and stomach burn that comes with alcohol consumption, because anti-addictive behavior has been noted in a number of studies of FAAH inhibition. Some studies showed increased appetite, but I don't know of any in which FAAH inhibition led to obesity.

Today, there aren't many scientific ways to describe conscious experience. Qualia Research Institute is working to solve this problem. Goals are ambitious yet achievable:

- Develop a precise mathematical language for describing subjective experience

- Understand the nature of emotional valence (happiness and suffering)

- Map out the full space of possible conscious experiences

- Build technologies to radically improve people's lives

Qualia Computing is an inter-disciplinary project that seeks to identify the computational properties of subjective experience. As a series of subgoals, all of the following research programs will further this overarching goal:

1) Characterize the dimensions of the state-space of qualia reachable from a human mind. (e.g. [State-Space of Drug Effects: Results | Qualia  Computing](http://qualiacomputing.com/2015/06/09/state-space-of-drug-effects-results/))

2) Identify the computational trade-offs of different states of consciousness (e.g. superior performance on LSD). (e.g. [How to secretly communicate with people on LSD | Qualia  Computing](http://qualiacomputing.com/2015/05/22/how-to-secretly-communicate-with-people-on-lsd/))

3) Infer a crisp functional, chemical, quantum or computational signature of hedonic tone. (e.g. [Google Hedonics | Qualia  Computing](http://qualiacomputing.com/2015/11/27/google-hedonics/) )

4) Create quality psychophysical tools to investigate altered states of consciousness. (e.g. [Psychophysics for Psychedelic Research: Textures | Qualia  Computing](http://qualiacomputing.com/2015/04/20/psychophysics-for-psychedelic-research-textures/))

5) Explain the computational properties of phenomenal binding, and investigate ways of tweaking the way it operates (e.g. modify local phenomenal binding patterns using ultrasound brain stimulation).

6) Further philosophy of mind by identifying the causally efficacious ways in which consciousness provides computational benefits to a biological organism.

There are no formal expectations here. It is a do-ocracy. If you want to plan a project in this area, feel free to find collaborators in this group and make it happen.

The hippies are also right about things like "DMT is a high frequency state of consciousness, even relative to LSD."

See: [Modeling Psychedelic Tracers with QRI‚Äôs Psychophysics Toolkit: The Tracer Replication Tool | Qualia  Computing](https://qualiacomputing.com/2020/10/09/modeling-psychedelic-tracers-with-qris-psychophysics-toolkit-the-tracer-replication-tool/)

According to our tool, LSD produces flicker frequencies between 15-20hz.

DMT produces 30hz effects instead.

Always listen for clues when hippies talk about qualia. They're more likely to be in touch with the high energy palette of qualia dynamics than your average scientist.

We have a conversation with the pioneering theoretical neuroscientist Stephen Grossberg about his research, which he recently assembled in one place: the book 'Conscious Mind, Resonant Brain'.

Topics include: Adaptive Resonance Theory, the stability-plasticity dilemma, and the problems with deep learning and backprop.

https://twitter.com/therealcritiq/status/1525158542273134592  

Josha Bach gave a lecture at Redwood that intro'd me to Grossbergian neuroscience (i.e Adaptive Resonance Theory) & "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus".

=Aethetics=

Symmetrical groundlessness, but like, full of love for all that is, joyous divine aethetics for subagents in consonance, hyperanalytical models with predictive power, and so on

totally playful and innocent and cute and colorful and light and fast but relaxed

full of infinite intelligence, knowledge and wisdom, of the depth of the universe, but totally humble, as all beings have their own reality tunnels from the eternal tao that cannot be named to be fully known but each information processing system approximates it via different way of seeing that are all as valid

totally divine, compassionate, infinite limbs helping all being in the universe, deity of compassion, of love itself giving raise to the unfolding flow of life energy to all being in existence with love in and being a groundless ground, caring like a mother for the whole existence, flowing in the empty void, light infinitely shapeshifting into anlovy form, helping all beings be utterly blissful

the source without a center, location, time, doer, observer, that manifests and is all

Practice or not practice ‚Äîattention goes beyond.

Act or not act ‚Äîdecisions melt away.

Empty or not empty ‚Äîawakening mind is beyond.

Be or not be ‚Äîthere is a vastness wherein

These differences fade away.

Awareness ‚Äînot a word, not a thought, no description at all ‚Äî

Has as its axis no corrective, no holding a position.

Its nature is bare, steady, fresh and unfolding,

A vastness free from all effort and complications.

Rest where there is no change or time.

Everything is joined together in the void spacelessly timelessly

All of us, everything is utterly connected

Siblings in the womb of creation

The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao

Reality that can be put into words is not reality itself in its full form

May all beings be happy.

May all beings be healthy.

May all beings be free from danger.

May all beings live in peace.
