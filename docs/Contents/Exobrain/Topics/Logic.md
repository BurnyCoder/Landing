- Logic is a branch of philosophy that studies the principles of correct reasoning. It's a foundational discipline for many fields, including mathematics, computer science, and linguistics. Here's a comprehensive list of various branches and sub-disciplines within logic:

### 1. Classical Logic
   - Propositional Logic (or Sentential Logic)
   - First-Order Logic (or Predicate Logic)
   - Second-Order and Higher-Order Logic
   - Syllogistic Logic (Aristotelian Logic)

### 2. Non-Classical Logics
   - Modal Logic (Necessity and Possibility)
   - Temporal Logic (Time)
   - Deontic Logic (Duty and Obligation)
   - Epistemic Logic (Knowledge and Belief)
   - Doxastic Logic (Belief)
   - Conditional Logic (If-Then Statements)

### 3. [[Mathematical Logic]]
   - Set Theory
   - Proof Theory
   - Model Theory
   - Recursion Theory (or Computability Theory)
   - Constructive Logic (or Intuitionistic Logic)
   - Category Theory in Logic

### 4. Philosophical Logic
   - Philosophical Analysis of Logical Concepts
   - Logic and Language
   - Logic and Metaphysics
   - Logic and Epistemology

### 5. Symbolic Logic
   - Formal Syntax and Semantics
   - Symbolic Representation of Logical Formulas
   - Boolean Logic

### 6. Formal Systems
   - Axiomatic Systems
   - Formal Languages
   - Formal Proof Systems
   - Theorem Proving

### 7. Applied Logic
   - Informal Logic (Argumentation Theory)
   - Logic of Natural Language
   - Critical Thinking
   - Fallacies and Logical Errors
   - Rhetoric and Persuasion

### 8. Computational Logic
   - Logic Programming
   - Automated Reasoning
   - Computational Complexity of Logical Theories
   - Decision Procedures

### 9. Quantificational Logic
   - Existential and Universal Quantification
   - Quantifier Scope and Interpretation

### 10. Fuzzy Logic
   - Multi-valued Logic
   - Degrees of Truth
   - Applications in Control Systems and Artificial Intelligence

### 11. Paraconsistent Logic
   - Handling Contradictory Information
   - Dialetheism (True Contradictions)

### 12. Relevance Logic
   - Logical Relevance in Implication
   - Avoiding Paradoxes of Material Implication

### 13. Quantum Logic
   - Logic for Quantum Mechanics
   - Non-classical Probability Theory

### 14. Dialogic Logic
   - Logic of Dialogue and Argumentation
   - Interactive Proof Systems

### 15. History of Logic
   - Study of Historical Development and Figures in Logic

### 16. Bivalent and Multivalent Logics
   - Logics with More than Two Truth Values
   - Intermediate Truth Values

### 17. Bayesian Logic
   - Logic Based on Bayesian Probability

### 18. Inductive Logic
   - Reasoning from Specific to General
   - Probabilistic Reasoning

### 19. Counterfactual Reasoning
   - Logic of Hypotheticals and "What If" Scenarios

### 20. Formal Ethics
