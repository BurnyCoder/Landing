Set theory is not only a core part of mathematical logic but also an essential tool in various areas of mathematics. Its concepts and techniques are widely used in the study of algebra, topology, real analysis, and beyond. The study of set theory ranges from very concrete and applicable aspects to highly abstract and theoretical ones.
