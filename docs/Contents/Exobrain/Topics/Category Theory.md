- Category theory, a branch of [[mathematics]] that abstractly studies structures and systems, offers a unifying framework for understanding and formalizing relationships and transformations between mathematical structures. Here's a comprehensive list of various branches and topics within category theory:

### 1. Basic Concepts of Category Theory
   - Categories, Objects, and Morphisms: Fundamental elements of category theory where categories encapsulate mathematical structures, objects are the elements within these structures, and morphisms are the arrows representing functions between objects.
   - Functors and Natural Transformations: Functors map objects and morphisms from one category to another, while natural transformations are mappings between functors maintaining structural consistency.
   - Isomorphisms, Monomorphisms, and Epimorphisms: Isomorphisms are morphisms that can be reversed, monomorphisms are injective morphisms, and epimorphisms are surjective morphisms, each providing different ways of relating objects in categories.
   - Limits and Colimits: Concepts generalizing mathematical constructions like products and unions (limits) and sums and intersections (colimits) in category theory.
   - Universal Properties: Properties defining an object in terms of its relationships with other objects, often through unique morphisms.

### 2. Types of Categories
   - Small and Large Categories: Small categories have a set of morphisms, while large categories have a class, differentiating the scope of these categories.
   - Concrete Categories: Categories equipped with a faithful functor to the category of sets, grounding abstract category theory concepts in set theory.
   - Abelian Categories: Categories where morphisms form abelian groups, allowing the definition and study of concepts like exact sequences.
   - Topoi (Topos Theory): Categories resembling the category of sets, providing a framework for generalized set theory and logic.
   - Monoidal Categories: Categories equipped with a tensor product and a unit object, enabling the study of structures that can be 'multiplied.'
   - Symmetric and Braided Monoidal Categories: Extensions of monoidal categories, where objects and morphisms maintain symmetrical or braided relationships under tensor product.

### 3. Functorial Concepts
   - Covariant and Contravariant Functors: Covariant functors preserve the direction of morphisms between categories, whereas contravariant functors reverse them.
   - Representable Functors: Functors that are naturally isomorphic to a Hom functor, linking objects of a category to sets.
   - Equivalence of Categories: A pair of functors between two categories that are inverses of each other, up to natural isomorphism.
   - Adjoint Functors: Pairs of functors connecting two categories, where one functor is left adjoint and the other is right adjoint, formalizing a general notion of 'inverse operations.'
   - Yoneda Lemma: A fundamental result providing a way to represent objects in a category in terms of all morphisms into them.

### 4. Homological Algebra
   - Chain Complexes: Sequences of abelian groups connected by homomorphisms, fundamental in studying algebraic topology and homology.
   - Exact Sequences: Sequences of groups and homomorphisms where the image of one homomorphism equals the kernel of the next, critical in understanding algebraic structures.
   - Homology and Cohomology: Methods for assigning algebraic invariants to topological spaces, capturing their properties and relationships.
   - Derived Functors: Functors applied to objects in homological algebra, providing deeper insights into algebraic structures.
   - Ext and Tor Functors: Derived functors used to study extensions of modules and torsion in modules, respectively.

### 5. Higher Category Theory
   - n-Categories: Categories with morphisms between morphisms, extending up to 'n' levels, enriching the theory with higher-dimensional arrows.
   - Infinity-Categories: Categories extended to have morphisms between all levels, providing a framework for studying structures in infinite dimensions.
   - Higher-Dimensional Algebra: Algebraic structures within higher category theory, exploring relationships in dimensions beyond the classical scope.
