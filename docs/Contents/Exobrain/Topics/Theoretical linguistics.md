- Theoretical linguistics is a branch of linguistics that is concerned with developing models of linguistic knowledge to describe and explain linguistic phenomena. It encompasses a range of sub-disciplines that focus on different aspects of language structure and function. Here's a comprehensive list of the various branches and subfields within theoretical linguistics:

### 1. Phonetics
   - Articulatory Phonetics (Study of Speech Production)
   - Acoustic Phonetics (Study of Speech Sounds)
   - Auditory Phonetics (Study of Speech Perception)

### 2. Phonology
   - Segmental Phonology (Study of Individual Speech Sounds)
   - Suprasegmental Phonology (Study of Features like Stress, Tone, Intonation)
   - Phonotactics (Study of Sound Patterns and Constraints)
   - Prosody (Study of Rhythm, Stress, and Intonation)

### 3. Morphology
   - Inflectional Morphology (Study of Word Forms)
   - Derivational Morphology (Study of Word Formation)
   - Morphological Typology (Study of Morphological Processes Across Languages)
   - Morphophonology (Interface Between Morphology and Phonology)

### 4. Syntax
   - Generative Grammar (Study of the Rules that Govern Sentence Structure)
   - Syntactic Theory (Study of Syntactic Structures)
   - Transformational Grammar (Study of Transformations in Sentence Structure)
   - Dependency Grammar (Study of the Dependency Between Linguistic Units)

### 5. Semantics
   - Lexical Semantics (Study of Word Meanings)
   - Compositional Semantics (Study of Sentence Meaning)
   - Formal Semantics (Study of Meaning Through Mathematical Systems)
   - Cognitive Semantics (Study of Meaning, Understanding, and Conceptualization)

### 6. Pragmatics
   - Speech Act Theory (Study of How Utterances Function)
   - Conversational Implicature (Study of Implied Meanings)
   - Relevance Theory (Study of Communication and Cognition)
   - Discourse Analysis (Study of Language in Use)

### 7. Psycholinguistics (Overlap with Cognitive Science)
   - Language Acquisition (Study of How Language is Acquired)
   - Language Processing (Study of How Language is Understood, Processed, and Produced)
   - Neurolinguistics (Study of the Neural Mechanisms of Language)

### 8. Sociolinguistics (Overlap with Social Sciences)
   - Language Variation (Study of Differences in Language Use)
   - Language Change (Study of How Language Evolves Over Time)
   - Language Contact (Study of Languages in Contact with Each Other)

### 9. Historical Linguistics
   - Diachronic Linguistics (Study of Languages Over Time)
   - Etymology (Study of Word Histories)
   - Language Evolution (Study of the Origins and Development of Languages)

### 10. Comparative Linguistics
   - Language Typology (Study of the Classification of Languages)
   - Comparative Syntax (Comparative Analysis of Sentence Structures)
   - Comparative Phonology (Comparative Analysis of Phonological Systems)

### 11. Formal Linguistics
   - Model-Theoretic Linguistics (Study of Language via Logical Models)
   - Computational Linguistics (Study of Language via Computational Models)
   - Theoretical Syntax (Study of the Fundamental Principles of Sentence Structure)
   - Theoretical Phonology (Study of the Fundamental Principles of Sound Systems)

### 12. Applied Theoretical Linguistics
   - Language Documentation (Study of Techniques for Documenting Languages)
   - Language Revitalization (Study of Techniques for Reviving Endangered Languages)

### 13. Cognitive Linguistics
   - Conceptual Metaphor (Study of Metaphorical Thought and Language)
   - Mental Spaces and Conceptual Blending (Study of Conceptual Integration)

### 14. Structural Linguistics
   - Phonemics (Study of Phonemes)
   - Morphemics (Study of Morphemes)
   - Syntax and Semantics (Structural Analysis)

Theoretical linguistics is foundational for understanding how languages are structured, how they function, and how they are processed and learned. It intersects with a variety of disciplines, including psychology, anthropology, philosophy, and computer science.
