## Definitions
- Most popular [[artificial intelligence]] [[model|models]] in [[connectionist artificial intelligence]], a branch of [[machine learning]] models that are build using the principles of neuronal organization discovered by [[connectionism]] in [[biological neural network|biological neural networks]].
- Collection of connected artificial neurons (nodes with real number weights) forming synapses (connections, edges with weights), where neuron recieves signal (real number) and processes it (updates weights by nonlinear function).
