## Landscapes
Different ways to assign realism to various patterns are:
- physicalism (just part of what is real is physics, or all is physics)
- mathematicism (all is mathematics, and mathematical physics can be just a subset) 
- informationism/computationalism (all is information/computation)
- mentalism (all is mental)
- platonism (all is abstract forms) 
- neutral monism (all is something else that we can't put a label to, it's to our senses unreachable thing in itself that exists)
- illusionism (nothing is real)
- transcendental mysterianism (all is ineffable, we know nothing about what's actually exists, and all above is just mind games and linguistic confusion) 

Any those can hold alone nondually (all is x, only x holds, x is fundamental), or they can dualistically/pluralistically create subsets, categories, or combinations in complex (nonlinear) hierarchies/systems, for example:
- mind emerges from physics, from certain systems under some mathematical condition (no panpsychism) (emergentism) (in contrary when only fundamental physics exist and mind isn't real, that's reductive physicalism and mind illusionism)
- mind emerges from all physical systems (that are under some mathematical heuristic segmented) in panpsychism 
- mind is (special case of) physics (our experience is the brain's physics itself) (Qualia Research Institute)
- mind is a special case of computation (algorithmic), which is emergent from fundamental physics, or emergent from fundamental universe's information, or both if its combined (Joscha Bach)
- mind and physics cocauses eachother
- mind emerges from/is special case of physics which emerges from/is special case of information which emerges from/is special case of mathematics which emerges from/is special case of abstract forms which emerges from/is special case of deeper ieffable (reductivism, emergentism, subsetism)
- physics emerges from mind (dualistic mentalism causing physics)
- physics is computation, which also is mathematics (people that assert only true real mathematics is the math that is implementable in physics by computation)
- from fundamental physics emerge all other physical laws on all other scales, that are all as real, that can or don't have to be emergent from the deeper levels as they can exist on their own (fundamentalphysicalism? allofphysicalism?) 
- mind emerges from neuroscience that emerges from physics (neuroscientism? how about biologism (all organisms, or just humans, how about bacteria and viruses? are by humans artificially created organisms with mind realistic?), chemistrysm, sociologism, planetism, galaxyism,... staticisism, networkism, complex dynamical chaotic cybernetic systemism,... is it all real on its own, emergent, or just (useful) illusions?)
- physicalism is part of more general world of mathematical forms (and what fundamental physics theory do you subscribe to as being fundamental? quantum field theory? loop quantum gravity? string theory? all of them approximating the true physical theory of everything that we have yet to find? is it findable with our limited data, information processing, frame of reference etc.?)
- all is fundamental physics/mind/information and everything else is just "illusion" on top of that (reductivism, illusionism)
- physical laws or computation and information or other laws exists across scales with various upwards and downwards causations in synergy happening between scales everywhere (Free Energy Principle is close to this)
- collective mind emerges from individual minds
- fundamental physics is collective mind
- everything is a different illusory or emergent lens on the ineffable (pluralism, Three Blind Men and an Elephant)
- every possible configuration is true... but also not true... all models are correctly approximating the ineffable reality according to how predictive they are? all models are wrong but some are useful? bayesian pragmatism? (scientific method, LessWrong) (or frequentist?) 

So many more combinations are possible in this ontological algebra! 
I also suspect there are genetic/environmental neural correlates that can predict what ontological framework one tends to subscribe to. 
- Working with computers, AI, information theory all day? Computationalism and information as fundamental might make the bayesian belief with the most evidence!
- Working with physics all day? Physicalism might make the most sense as that's the memes that are populated in your brain. 
- Subscribing to hardcore mentalism? You maybe experienced some extremely significiant experience giving infinite meaning to consciousness. 
- Subscribing to complex hierarchies? There might be complex hierarchies in the brain that you cultivated over your intellectual path. 
- Subscribing to hardcore dualism? Your brain mind have more dual structure between model of one's mind and the environment. 
- Trying to integrate various fields? Forming complex hierarchies on top of fundamental physics might make sense. 
- Trying to integrate various perspectives? Multiperspectival/Omniperspectival parralel ontological models with similarities between eachother for you!
- Very reductive? Mind might have very from first principles information processing. 
- Subscribing to transcendentalism? Your mind might be transcending all rigid concepts it tries to form. 
- Want to feel highest agency possible over your mind? All is mind then. (But what about substances and neurotechnologies? Upgrade your agency with those too!)
- Want to feel one with everything? All is God mind cosplaying as individual minds then for you!
- Are you ok with any configuration as long as it maximizes empirical predictions? (Multiperspectival) bayesian pragmatism might be for you!
