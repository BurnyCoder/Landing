## Brain storming
- Můj hlavní cíl je vytvořit velkou vizuální mapu, která má co nejvíc informací o matematice přes ukázání těch nejdůležitějších matematických struktur, definic, rovnic, s co nejmenší textovou omáčkou kolem, chci aby co největší % mapy byly hlavně nejvíc matematický symboly, celý v jednom obřím čitelným plagátu! Což jsem ještě neviděl. Jsou nějaký mapy, tabulky, seznamy, wikiny apod. matematiky, ze kterých se inspiruju, ale neviděl jsem nic jako vizuální mapu tuny definicí a rovnic z hlavně foundations matiky, čistou matiku a aplikovanou matiku: teoretickou fyziku, teorii systémů, matematickou biologii, AI, ostatní matematický aplikovaný vědy a engineering obory, který vidím za nejdůležitější. Často jsou moc obecný nebo moc konkrétní jinde než chci. Existuje třeba mapa matiky od [domain of science](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ-4B-mS-Y>), nebo [fyziky](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZihywtixUYo>) (má jich [víc](<https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=f032846a98b531f9&sxsrf=ACQVn0976HXiiNvRPJyyV5C4j7DIBC8eyQ:1709279314434&q=map+of+physics&tbm=vid>)), [Mathematopia](<https://tomrocksmaths.com/2020/12/21/mathematopia-the-adventure-map-of-mathematics/>), [geometric representation of mathematics](<https://imgur.com/Tgd6HmA>) [http://srln.se/mapthematics.pdf](http://srln.se/mapthematics.pdf) , od [Zooga](<https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/2av79v/map_of_mathematistan_source_in_comments/>), [tahle Laglands nádhera](https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/2020/langlands/), nebo [tady jich pár je listed v math stackexchange](<https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/124709/mind-maps-of-advanced-mathematics-and-various-branches-thereof>) nebo [google search nachází nějaký další](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=6416b2a2bca84fa5&sxsrf=ACQVn08EYgLRVx_d0OEctey6oKUsAtsrOg:1709276455770&q=map+of+mathematics&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjUgeD_vtKEAxXS0AIHHaQOBFoQ0pQJegQICxAB&biw=1920&bih=878&dpr=1). Plus Peak math staví velkou vizuální interaktivní [mapu](https://www.peakmath.org/peakmath-landscape).  
Nebo je ještě existují různý wikiny a seznamy: [Wikipedie](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_science#Branches_of_science>) ([Matika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics): [category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mathematics), [outline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_mathematics), [portal](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Mathematics>), [list of topics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_mathematics_topics), [areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Areas_of_mathematics), [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fields_of_mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fields_of_mathematics) nebo [fyzika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics): [category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Physics), [outline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_physics), [portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Physics)), [encyklopedia of mathematics](https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Main_Page), [Wolfram math world](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/), [Mathematics Subject Classification](https://zbmath.org/classification/)([na wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_Subject_Classification)), [math fandom](https://math.fandom.com/wiki/Math_Wiki), [mathematics atlas](https://web.archive.org/web/20150429140457/http://www.math.niu.edu/%7Erusin/known-math/welcome.html), [awesome math](https://github.com/rossant/awesome-math), [tenhle strom](https://imgur.com/d8KqaFx) apod., ale to nejsou vizuální mapy tím jak jsou to wikiny, a jsou v nějakých věcech nedostatečně specializovaný nebo až moc detailní a dávají tam všemožnou omáčku kolem těch rovnic, a já chci s co nejmenší omáčkou mít v obří mapě co nejvíc jen ty matematický symboly. Nebo ještě rád promptuju AIs a snažím se z nich vydolovat koncepty, rovnice, asociace kolem různých oborů a témat přes prompty typu "write a gigantic list of all subfields in math/physics", "write a gigantic list of the most important structures and equations used in this subfield of physics or mathematics", apod. a ty pak dohledávám.  
Nebo [The Princeton Companion to Mathematics](<https://www.amazon.com/Princeton-Companion-Mathematics-Timothy-Gowers/dp/0691118809>)([pdf](<https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/akherim/PCM.pdf>)) [https://www.amazon.com/Princeton-Companion-Applied-Mathematics/dp/0691150397?ref=d6k_applink_bb_dls&dplnkId=352f8fc3-ee97-4716-817a-e8feea9cd8c2](https://www.amazon.com/Princeton-Companion-Applied-Mathematics/dp/0691150397?ref=d6k_applink_bb_dls&dplnkId=352f8fc3-ee97-4716-817a-e8feea9cd8c2) kniha vypadá zajímavě, nebo je ještě [Mathematical Promenade](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06373). Nebo je ještě [proof wiki](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Category:Proofs), ale to je hlavně na proofs, já chci hlavně dát na jedno místo ty výsledky co nejvíc kompresovaně, aby se těch výsledných definicí, rovnic a různých propojeních vešlo co nejvíc na co nejmíň místa. Nebo quanta magazine má mapu na trochu [matiky](<https://mathmap.quantamagazine.org/map/>) a [fyziky](<https://www.quantamagazine.org/theories-of-everything-mapped-20150803/>). Wiki má ještě fajn [theoretical physics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physics>) a [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics) nebo [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology), trillion [AI theory matiky](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10165) (principles of deep learning theory, statistical learning theory), [free energy principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06387),... Dynamical systems, systems theory,... Nebo je ještě [nlab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) ([matika](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mathematics), [fyzika](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/higher+category+theory+and+physics)) ale to hlavně magie od šílenců z teorií kategorií, toho chci mít jenom část mý mapy, teorie kategorií svěle umožňuje propojovat jednotlivý matematický vesmíry ([od Math3ma](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-category-theory-anyway), [od Southwella](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCTMeyjMKRkoS699U0OJ3ymr3r01sI08l)). Tenhle týpek má fajn list [konkrétnějších knížek podoborů matiky](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/kqnfn5/suggestions_for_starting_a_personal_library/gi9k4gj/?context=3). p  
Nejradši bych si to prošel úplně všechno do těch nejmenšejšíšch detailíčků a naučil se všechno, ale potřeboval bych nekonečno času. :smile:  
Já chci do ruky to nový pro všechny neveřejný Googlí AI s lepším reasoningem a kvalitnější a 100x větší pamětí než ChatGPT a všechno mu to nacpat. 😄 Nebo použít dosavadní veřejný LLMs s databázovou pamětí aka groundingem nebo finetuningem, hmm.
